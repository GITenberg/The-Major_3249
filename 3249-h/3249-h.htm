    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COWARD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Spring had come. Despite the many wet and gusty days which April had
      thrust in rude challenge upon reluctant May, in the glory of the
      triumphant sun which flooded the concave blue of heaven and the myriad
      shaded green of earth, the whole world knew to-day, the whole world
      proclaimed that spring had come. The yearly miracle had been performed.
      The leaves of the maple trees lining the village street unbound from their
      winter casings, the violets that lifted brave blue eyes from the vivid
      grass carpeting the roadside banks, the cherry and plum blossoms in the
      orchards decking the still leafless trees with their pink and white
      favours, the timid grain tingeing with green the brown fields that ran up
      to the village street on every side&mdash;all shouted in chorus that
      spring had come. And all the things with new blood running wild in their
      veins, the lambs of a few days still wobbly on ridiculous legs skipping
      over and upon the huge boulders in farmer Martin's meadow, the birds
      thronging the orchard trees, the humming insects rioting in the genial
      sun, all of them gave token of strange new impulses calling for something
      more than mere living because spring had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the topmost tip of the taller of the twin poplars that flanked the
      picket gate opening upon the Gwynnes' little garden sat a robin, his head
      thrown back to give full throat to the song that was like to burst his
      heart, monotonous, unceasing, rapturous. On the door step of the Gwynnes'
      house, arrested on the threshold by the robin's song, stood the Gwynne boy
      of ten years, his eager face uplifted, himself poised like a bird for
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Law-r-ence," clear as a bird call came the voice from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mo-th-er," rang the boy's voice in reply, high, joyous and shrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ear-ly! Remember!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ri-ght a-way af-ter school. Good-bye, mo-ther, dear," called the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "W-a-i-t," came the clear, birdlike call again, and in a moment the mother
      came running, stood beside the boy, and followed his eye to the robin on
      the poplar tree. "A brave little bird," she said. "That is the way to meet
      the day, with a brave heart and a bright song. Goodbye, boy." She kissed
      him as she spoke, giving him a slight pat on the shoulder. "Away you go."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy stood fascinated by the bird so gallantly facing his day. His
      mother's words awoke in him a strange feeling. "A brave heart and a bright
      song"&mdash;so the knights in the brave days of old, according to his
      Stories of the Round Table, were wont to go forth. In imitation of the
      bird, the boy threw back his head, and with another cheery good-bye to his
      mother, sprang clear of the steps and ran down the grass edged path,
      through the gate and out onto the village street. There he stood first
      looking up the country road which in the village became a street. There
      was nothing to be seen except that in the Martin orchard "Ol' Martin" was
      working with his team under the trees which came in rows down to the road.
      Finding nothing to interest him there, he turned toward the village and
      his eyes searched the street. Opposite the Gwynnes' gate, Dr. Bush's house
      stood back among the trees, but there was no sign of life about it.
      Further down on the same side of the street, the Widow Martin's cottage,
      with porch vine covered and windows bright with flowers, hid itself under
      a great spreading maple. In front of the cottage the Widow Martin herself
      was busy in the garden. He liked the Widow Martin but found her not
      sufficiently exciting to hold him this spring morning. A vacant lot or two
      and still on the same side came the blacksmith's shop just at the
      crossroads, and across the street from it his father's store. But neither
      at the blacksmith's shop nor at the store across from it was there
      anything to awaken even a passing interest. Some farmers' teams and dogs,
      Pat Larkin's milk wagon with its load of great cans on its way to the
      cheese factory and some stray villagers here and there upon the street
      intent upon their business. Up the street his eye travelled beyond the
      crossroads where stood on the left Cheatley's butcher shop and on the
      right McKenny's hotel with attached sheds and outhouses. Over the bridge
      and up the hill the street went straight away, past the stone built
      Episcopal Church whose spire lifted itself above the maple trees, past the
      Rectory, solid, square and built of stone, past the mill standing on the
      right back from the street beside the dam, over the hill, and so
      disappeared. The whole village seemed asleep and dreaming among its maple
      trees in the bright sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing another glance at the robin still singing on the treetop
      overhead, the boy took from his pocket a mouth-organ, threw back his head,
      squared his elbows out from his sides to give him the lung room he needed,
      and in obedience to a sharp word of command after a preliminary tum, tum,
      tum, struck up the ancient triumph hymn in memory of that hero of the
      underground railroad by which so many slaves of the South in bygone days
      made their escape "up No'th" to Canada and to freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glory, glory, hallelujah, his soul goes marching on." By means of
      "double-tongueing," a recently acquired accomplishment, he was able to
      give a full brass band effect to his hymn of freedom. Many villagers from
      door or window cast a kindly and admiring eye upon the gallant little
      figure stepping to his own music down the street. He was brass band,
      conductor, brigadier general all in one, and behind him marched an army of
      heroes off for war and deathless glory, invisible and invincible. To the
      Widow Martin as he swung past the leader flung a wave of his hand. With a
      tender light in her old eyes the Widow Martin waved back at him. "God
      bless his bright face," she murmured, pausing in her work to watch the
      upright little figure as he passed along. At the blacksmith's shop the
      band paused.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Tink, tink, tink, tink,
      Tink, tink-a-tink-tink-tink.
        Tink tink, tink, tink,
      Tink, tink-a-tink-tink-tink.
</pre>
    <p>
      The conductor graduated the tempo so as to include the rhythmic beat of
      the hammer with the other instruments in his band. The blacksmith looked,
      smiled and let his hammer fall in consonance with the beat of the boy's
      hand, and for some moments there was glorious harmony between anvil and
      mouth organ and the band invisible. At the store door across the street
      the band paused long enough simply to give and receive an answering salute
      from the storekeeper, who smiled upon his boy as he marched past. At the
      crossroads the band paused, marking time. There was evidently a momentary
      uncertainty in the leader's mind as to direction. The road to the right
      led straight, direct, but treeless, dusty, uninviting, to the school. It
      held no lure for the leader and his knightly following. Further on a path
      led in a curve under shady trees and away from the street. It made the way
      to school longer, but the lure of the curving, shady path was
      irresistible. Still stepping bravely to the old abolitionist hymn, the
      procession moved along, swung into the path under the trees and suddenly
      came to a halt. With a magnificent flourish the band concluded its
      triumphant hymn and with the conductor and brigadier the whole brigade
      stood rigidly at attention. The cause of this sudden halt was to be seen
      at the foot of a maple tree in the person of a fat lump of good natured
      boy flesh supine upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Joe; coming to school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh," grunted Joe, from the repose of limitless calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, then, quick, march." Once more the band struck up its hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hol' on, Larry, it's plenty tam again," said Joe. The band came to a
      stop. "I don' lak dat school me," he continued, still immersed in calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe's struggles with an English education were indeed tragically pathetic.
      His attempts with aspirates were a continual humiliation to himself and a
      joy to the whole school. No wonder he "no lak dat school." Besides, Joe
      was a creature of the open fields. His French Canadian father, Joe
      Gagneau, "Ol' Joe," was a survival of a bygone age, the glorious golden
      age of the river and the bush, of the shanty and the raft, of the axe and
      the gun, the age of Canadian romance, of daring deed, of wild adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' it ees half-hour too queek," persisted Joe. "Come on hup to de dam."
      A little worn path invited their feet from the curving road, and following
      their feet, they found themselves upon a steep embankment which dammed the
      waters into a pond that formed the driving power for the grist mill
      standing near. At the farther end of the pond a cedar bush interposed a
      barrier to the sight and suggested mysterious things beyond. Back of the
      cedar barrier a woods of great trees, spruce, balsam, with tall elms and
      maples on the higher ground beyond, offered deeper mysteries and delights
      unutterable. They knew well the cedar swamp and the woods beyond.
      Partridges drummed there, rabbits darted along their beaten runways, and
      Joe had seen a woodcock, that shyest of all shy birds, disappear in
      glancing, shadowy flight, a ghostly, silent denizen of the ghostly, silent
      spaces of the forest. Even as they gazed upon that inviting line of woods,
      the boys could see and hear the bluejays flash in swift flight from tree
      to tree and scream their joy of rage and love. From the farther side of
      the pond two boys put out in a flat-bottomed boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's big Ben and Mop," cried Larry eagerly. "Hello, Ben," he called
      across the pond. "Goin' to school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yap," cried Mop, so denominated from the quantity and cut of the hair
      that crowned his head. Ben was at the oars which creaked and thumped
      between the pins, but were steadily driving the snub-nosed craft on its
      toilsome way past the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Ben," cried Larry. "Take us in too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Ben, heading the boat for the bank. "Let me take an oar,
      Ben," said Larry, whose experience upon the world of waters was not any
      too wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, where you goin'," cried Mop, as the boat slowly but surely pointed
      toward the cedars. "You stop pulling, Ben. Now, Larry, pull around again.
      There now, she's right. Pull, Ben." But Ben sat rigid with his eyes intent
      upon the cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, Ben?" said Larry. Still Ben sat with fixed gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By gum, he's in, boys," said Ben in a low voice. "I thought he had his
      nest in one of them stubs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it&mdash;in what stub?" inquired Larry, his voice shrill with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That big middle stub, there," said Ben. "It's a woodpecker. Say, let's
      pull down and see it." Under Mop's direction the old scow gradually made
      its way toward the big stub.
    </p>
    <p>
      They explored the stub, finding in it a hole and in the hole a nest, the
      mother and father woodpeckers meanwhile flying in wild agitation from stub
      to stub and protesting with shrill cries against the intruders. Then they
      each must climb up and feel the eggs lying soft and snug in their comfy
      cavity. After that they all must discuss the probable time of hatching,
      the likelihood of there being other nests in other stubs which they
      proceeded to visit. So the eager moments gaily passed into minutes all
      unheeded, till inevitable recollection dragged them back from the world of
      adventure and romance to that of stern duty and dull toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, boys, we'll be late," cried Larry, in sudden panic, seizing his oar.
      "Come on, Ben, let's go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess it's pretty late now," replied Ben, slowly taking up his oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat bell, I hear him long tam," said Joe placidly. "Oh, Joe!" cried Larry
      in distress. "Why didn't you tell us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe shrugged his shoulders. He was his own master and superbly indifferent
      to the flight of time. With him attendance at school was a thing of more
      or less incidental obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll catch it all right," said Mop with dark foreboding. "He was awful
      mad last time and said he'd lick any one who came late again and keep him
      in for noon too."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect was sufficiently gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, let's hurry up anyway," cried Larry, who during his school career had
      achieved a perfect record for prompt and punctual attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ever deepening dejection the discussion proceeded until at length Mop
      came forward with a daring suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, boys, let's wait until noon. He won't notice anything. We can easily
      fool him."
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought no comfort to Larry, however, whose previous virtues would
      only render this lapse the more conspicuous. A suggestion of Joe's turned
      the scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat woodchuck," he said, "he's got one hole on de hill by dere. He's big
      feller. We dron heem out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, let's," cried Mop. "It will be awful fun to drown the beggar
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess we can't do much this morning, anyway," said Ben, philosophically
      making the best of a bad job. "Let's go, Larry." And much against his
      will, but seeing no way out of the dilemma, Larry agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They explored the woodchuck hole, failing to drown out that cunning
      subterranean architect who apparently had provided lines of retreat for
      just such emergencies as confronted him now. Wearied of the woodchuck,
      they ranged the bush seeking and finding the nests of bluejays and of
      woodpeckers, and in a gravel pit those of the sand martens. Joe led them
      to the haunts of the woodcock, but that shy bird they failed to glimpse.
      Long before the noon hour they felt the need of sustenance and found that
      Larry's lunch divided among the four went but a small way in satisfying
      their pangs of hunger. The other three, carefree and unconcerned for what
      the future might hold, roamed the woods during the afternoon, but to Larry
      what in other circumstances would have been a day of unalloyed joy,
      brought him only a present misery and a dread for the future. The question
      of school for the afternoon was only mentioned to be dismissed. They were
      too dirty and muddy to venture into the presence of the master.
      Consequently the obvious course was to wait until four o'clock when
      joining the other children they might slip home unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon soon began to lag. The woods had lost their first glamour.
      Their games grew to be burdensome. They were weary and hungry, and
      becoming correspondingly brittle in temper. Already Nemesis was on their
      trail. Sick at heart and weighted with forebodings, Larry listened to the
      plans of the other boys by which they expected to elude the consequences
      of their truancy. In the discussion of their plans Larry took no part.
      They offered him no hope. He knew that if he were prepared to lie, as they
      had cheerfully decided, his simple word would carry him through at home.
      But there the difficulty arose. Was he willing to lie? He had never lied
      to his mother in all his life. He visualised her face as she listened to
      him recounting his falsified tale of the day's doings and unconsciously he
      groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with you, Larry?" inquired Mop, noticing his pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing; it's getting a little cold, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cold!" laughed Mop. "I guess you're getting scared all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Larry made no reply. He was too miserable, too tired to explain
      his state of mind. He was doubtful whether he could explain to Mop or to
      Joe his unwillingness to lie to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It don't take much to scare you anyway," said Mop with an ugly grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was not without its anxieties to Mop, for while he felt
      fairly confident as to his ability to meet successfully his mother's cross
      examination, there was always a possibility of his father's taking a hand,
      and that filled him with a real dismay. For Mr. Sam Cheatley, the village
      butcher, was a man of violent temper, hasty in his judgments and merciless
      in his punishment. There was a possibility of unhappy consequences for Mop
      in spite of his practiced ability in deception. Hence his nerves were set
      a-jangling, and his temper, never very certain, was rather on edge. The
      pale face of the little boy annoyed him, and the little whimsical smile
      which never quite left his face confronted him like an insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're scared," reiterated Mop with increasing contempt, "and you know
      you're scared. You ain't got any spunk anyway. You ain't got the spunk of
      a louse." With a quick grip he caught the boy by the collar (he was almost
      twice Larry's size), and with a jerk landed him on his back in a brush
      heap. The fall brought Larry no physical hurt, but the laughter of Joe and
      especially of big Ben, who in his eyes was something of a hero, wounded
      and humiliated him. The little smile, however, did not leave his face and
      he picked himself up and settled his coat about his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ain't no good anyway," continued Mop, with the native instinct of the
      bully to worry his victim. "You can't play nothin' and you can't lick
      nobody in the whole school."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of these charges Larry felt were true. He was not fond of games and
      never had he experienced a desire to win fame as a fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, let him alone, can't you, Mop?" said big Ben. "He ain't hurtin' you
      none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurtin' me," cried Mop, who for some unaccountable reason had worked
      himself into a rage. "He couldn't hurt me if he tried. I could lick him on
      my knees with one hand behind my back. I believe Joe there could lick him
      with one hand tied behind his back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet he can't," said Ben, measuring Larry with his eye and desiring to
      defend him from this degrading accusation. "I bet he'd put up a pretty
      fine scrap," continued Ben, "if he had to." Larry's heart warmed to his
      champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if he had to," replied Mop with a sneer. "But he would never have
      to. He wouldn't fight a flea. Joe can lick him with one hand, can't you,
      Joe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I donno. I don' want fight me," said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I know you don't want to, but you could, couldn't you?" persisted
      Mop. Joe shrugged his shoulders. "Ha, I told you so. Hurrah for my man,"
      cried Mop, clapping Joe on the back and pushing him toward Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben began to scent sport. He was also conscious of a rising resentment
      against Mop's exultant tone and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet you," he said, "if Larry wanted to, he could lick Joe even if he
      had both hands, but if Joe's one hand is tied behind his back, why Larry
      would just whale the tar out of him. But Larry does not want to fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," jeered Mop, "you bet he don't, he ain't got it in him. I bet you he
      daren't knock a chip off Joe's shoulder, and I will tie Joe's hand behind
      his back with his belt. Now there he is, bring your man on. There's a chip
      on his shoulder too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry looked at Joe, the little smile still on his face. "I don't want to
      fight Joe. What would I fight Joe for?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you so," cried Mop, dancing about. "He ain't got no fight in him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Take a dare,
     Take a dare,
     Chase a cat,
     And hunt a hare."
</pre>
    <p>
      Ben looked critically at Larry as if appraising the quality of his soul.
      "Joe can't lick you with one hand tied behind his back, can he, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to fight Joe," persisted Larry still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ya, ya," persisted Mop. "Here, Joe, you knock this chip off Larry's
      shoulder." Mop placed the gauge of battle on Larry's shoulder. "Go ahead,
      Joe."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Joe a fight with a friend or a foe was an event of common occurrence.
      With even a more dangerous opponent than Larry he would not have
      hesitated. For to decline a fight was with Joe utterly despicable. So
      placing himself in readiness for the blow that should have been the
      inevitable consequence, he knocked the chip off Larry's shoulder. Still
      Larry smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, your man's no good. He won't fight," cried Mop with unspeakable
      disgust. "I told you he wouldn't fight. Do you know why he won't fight?
      His mother belongs to that people, them Quakers, that won't fight for
      anything. He's a coward an' his mother's a coward before him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile faded from Larry's lips. His face which had been pale flamed a
      quick red, then as quickly became dead white. He turned from Joe and
      looked at the boy who was tormenting him. Mop was at least four years
      older, strongly and heavily built. For a moment Larry stood as though
      estimating Mop's fighting qualities. Then apparently making up his mind
      that on ordinary terms, owing to his lack in size and in strength, he was
      quite unequal to his foe, he looked quickly about him and his eye fell
      upon a stout and serviceable beechwood stake. With quiet deliberation he
      seized the club and began walking slowly toward Mop, his eyes glittering
      as if with madness, his face white as that of the dead. So terrifying was
      his appearance that Mop began to back away. "Here you, look out," he
      cried, "I will smash you." But Larry still moved steadily upon him. His
      white face, his burning eyes, his steady advance was more than Mop could
      endure. His courage broke. He turned and incontinently fled. Whirling the
      stick over his head, Larry flung the club with all his might after him.
      The club caught the fleeing Mop fairly between the shoulders. At the same
      time his foot caught a root. Down he went upon his face, uttering cries of
      deadly terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep him off, keep him off. He will kill me, he will kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Larry having shot his bolt ignored his fallen enemy, and without a
      glance at him, or at either of the other boys, or without a word to any of
      them, he walked away through the wood, and deaf to their calling
      disappeared through the cedar swamp and made straight for home and to his
      mother. With even, passionless voice, with almost no sign of penitence, he
      told her the story of the day's truancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her discriminating eye was quick in discerning his penitence, so her
      forgiveness was quick in meeting his sin. But though her forgiveness
      brought the boy a certain measure of relief he seemed almost to take it
      for granted, and there still remained on his face a look of pain and of
      more than pain that puzzled his mother. He seemed to be in a maze of
      uncertainty and doubt and fear. His mother could not understand his
      distress, for Larry had told her nothing of his encounter with Mop.
      Throughout the evening there pounded through the boy's memory the terrible
      words, "He is a coward and his mother is a coward before him." Through his
      father's prayer at evening worship those words continued to beat upon his
      brain. He tried to prepare his school lessons for the day following, but
      upon the page before his eyes the same words took shape. He could not
      analyse his unutterable sense of shame. He had been afraid to fight. He
      knew he was a coward, but there was a deeper shame in which his mother was
      involved. She was a Quaker, he knew, and he had a more or less vague idea
      that Quakers would not fight. Was she then a coward? That any reflection
      should be made upon his mother stabbed him to the heart. Again and again
      Mop's sneering, grinning face appeared before his eyes. He felt that he
      could have gladly killed him in the woods, but after all, the paralysing
      thought ever recurred that what Mop said was true. His mother was a
      coward! He put his head down upon his books and groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, dear?" inquired his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to bed, mother," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your head bad?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, mother. It is nothing. I am tired," he said, and went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she went to sleep the mother, as was her custom, looked in upon
      him. The boy was lying upon his face with his arms flung over his head,
      and when she turned him over to an easier position, on the pillow and on
      his cheeks were the marks of tears. Gently she pushed back the thick,
      black, wavy locks from his forehead, and kissed him once and again. The
      boy turned his face toward her. A long sobbing sigh came from his parted
      lips. He opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you, mother?" he asked, the old whimsical smile at his lips.
      "Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He settled down into the clothes and in a moment was fast asleep. The
      mother stood looking down upon her boy. He had not told her his trouble,
      but her touch had brought him comfort, and for the rest she was content to
      wait.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A FIGHT FOR FREEDOM
    </h3>
    <p>
      The village schoolhouse was packed to the door. Over the crowded forms
      there fell a murky light from the smoky swinging lamp that left dark
      unexplored depths in the corners of the room. On the walls hung
      dilapidated maps at angles suggesting the interior of a ship's cabin
      during a storm, or a party of revellers, returning homeward, after the
      night before, gravely hilarious. Behind the platform a blackboard, cracked
      into irregular spaces, preserved the mental processes of the pupils during
      their working hours, and in sharp contrast to these the terribly
      depressing perfection of the teacher's exemplar in penmanship, which
      reminded the self-complacent slacker that "Eternal vigilance is the price
      of freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an evangelistic meeting. Behind the table, his face illumined by
      the lamp thereon, stood a man turning over the leaves of a hymn book. His
      aspect suggested a soul, gentle, mild and somewhat abstracted from its
      material environment. The lofty forehead gave promise of an idealism
      capable of high courage, indeed of sacrifice&mdash;a promise, however,
      belied somewhat by an irresolute chin partly hidden by a straggling beard.
      But the face was sincere and tenderly human. At his side upon the platform
      sat his wife behind a little portable organ, her face equally gentle,
      sincere and irresolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembly&mdash;with the extraordinary patience that characterises
      public assemblies&mdash;waited for the opening of the meeting, following
      with attentive eyes the vague and trifling movements of the man at the
      table. Occasionally there was a rumble of deep voices in conversation, and
      in the dark corners subdued laughter&mdash;while on the front benches the
      animated and giggling whispering of three little girls tended to relieve
      the hour from an almost superhuman gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length with a sudden acquisition of resolution the evangelist glanced
      at his watch, rose, and catching up a bundle of hymn books from the table
      thrust them with unnecessary energy into the hands of a boy who sat on the
      side bench beside his mother. The boy was Lawrence Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take these," said the man, "and distribute them, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawrence taken thus by surprise paled, then flushed a quick red. He
      glanced up at his mother and at her slight nod took the books and
      distributed them among the audience on one side of the room while the
      evangelist took the other. As the lad passed from bench to bench with his
      books he was greeted with jocular and slightly jeering remarks in
      undertone by the younger members of the company, which had the effect of
      obviously increasing the ineptitude of his thin nervous fingers, but could
      not quite dispel the whimsical smile that lingered about the corners of
      his mouth and glanced from the corners of his grey-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting opened with the singing of a popular hymn which carried a
      refrain catchy enough but running to doggerel. Another hymn followed and
      another. Then abruptly the evangelist announced,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we shall have a truly GREAT hymn, a hymn you must sing in a truly
      great way, in what we call the grand style, number three hundred and
      sixty-seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a voice, deep, thrilling, vibrant with a noble emotion, he read
      the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "When I survey the wondrous cross
        On which the Prince of Glory died,
      My richest gain I count but loss,
        And pour contempt on all my pride."
</pre>
    <p>
      They sang the verse, and when they had finished he stood looking at them
      in silence for a moment or two, then announced solemnly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends, that will not do for this hymn. Sing it with your hearts. Listen
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sang a verse in a deep, strong baritone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now try."
    </p>
    <p>
      Timidly they obeyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not at all," he shouted at them. "Listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again with exquisitely distinct articulation and in a tone rich in emotion
      and carrying in it the noble, penetrating pathos of the great words in
      which is embodied the passion of that heart subduing world tragedy. He
      would not let them try it again, but alone sang the hymn to the end. By
      the spell of his voice he had gripped them by the heart. The giggling
      girls in the front seat sat gazing at him with open mouths and lifted
      eyes. From every corner of the room faces once dull were filled with a
      great expectant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will never sing those words as you should," he cried, "until you know
      and feel the glory of that wondrous cross. Never, never, never." His voice
      rose in a passionate crescendo.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had finished singing the last great verse, he let his eyes wander
      over the benches until they rested upon the face of the lad on the side
      bench near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha, boy," he cried. "You can sing those words. Try that last verse."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stared, fascinated, at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sing the last verse, boy," commanded the evangelist, "sing."
    </p>
    <p>
      As if impelled by another will than his own, the boy slowly, with his eyes
      still fastened on the man's face, threw back his head and began to sing.
      His voice rose, full, strong, in a quaint imitation in method of
      articulation and in voice production of the evangelist himself. At the
      third line of the verse the evangelist joined in great massive tones,
      beating time vigorously in a rallentando.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Love so amazing, so divine,
      Demands my soul, my life, my all."
</pre>
    <p>
      The effect was a great emotional climax, the spiritual atmosphere was
      charged with fervour. The people sat rigid, fixed in their places,
      incapable of motion, until released by the invitation of the leader, "Let
      us pray." The boy seemed to wake as from a sleep, glanced at his mother,
      then at the faces of the people in the room, sat down, and quickly covered
      his face with his hands and so remained during the prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic effect of the singing was gradually dispelled in the prayer
      and in a Scripture reading which followed. By the time the leader was
      about to begin his address, the people had almost relapsed into their
      normal mental and spiritual condition of benevolent neutrality. A second
      time a text was announced, when abruptly the door opened and up the aisle,
      with portentous impressiveness as of a stately ocean liner coming to
      berth, a man advanced whose presence seemed to fill the room and give it
      the feeling of being unpleasantly crowded. A buzz went through the seats.
      "The Rector! The Rector!" The evangelist gazed upon the approaching form
      and stood as if incapable of proceeding until this impressive personage
      should come to rest. Deliberately the Rector advanced to the side bench
      upon which Larry and his mother were seated, and slowly swinging into
      position calmly viewed the man upon the platform, the woman at the organ,
      the audience filling the room and then definitely came to anchor upon the
      bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preacher waited until this manoeuvre had been successfully
      accomplished, coughed nervously, made as if to move in the direction of
      the important personage on the side bench, hesitated, and finally with an
      air of embarrassment once more announced his text. At once the Rector was
      upon his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you pardon me, sir," he began with elaborate politeness. "Do I
      understand you're a clergyman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir," replied the evangelist, "just a plain preacher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not in any Holy Orders then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you an ordained or accredited minister of any of the&mdash;ah&mdash;dissenting
      bodies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir," demanded the Rector, "may I ask by what authority you presume
      to exercise the functions of the holy ministry and in my parish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;really&mdash;sir, I do not know why I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, let me tell you this will not be permitted," said the Rector
      sternly. "There are regularly ordained and accredited ministers of the
      Church and of all religious bodies represented in this neighbourhood, and
      your ministrations are not required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely, sir," said the evangelist hurriedly as if anxious to get in a
      word, "I may be permitted in this free country to preach the Gospel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, there are regularly ordained and approved ministers of the Gospel
      who are quite capable of performing this duty. I won't have it, sir. I
      must protect these people from unlicensed, unregulated&mdash;ah&mdash;persons,
      of whose character and antecedents we have no knowledge. Pray, sir," cried
      the Rector, taking a step toward the man on the platform, "whom do you
      represent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The evangelist drew himself up quietly and said, "My Lord and Master, sir.
      May I ask whom do you represent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a deadly thrust. For the first time during the encounter the Rector
      palpably gave ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh? Ah&mdash;sir&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;ahem&mdash;my standing in this
      community is perfectly assured as an ordained clergyman of the Church of
      England in Canada. Have you any organisation or church, any organised
      Christian body to which you adhere and to which you are responsible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Church of Christ&mdash;the body of believers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that an organised body with ordained ministers and holy sacraments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not believe in a paid ministry with special privileges and powers,"
      said the evangelist. "We believe that every disciple has a right to preach
      the glorious Gospel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then you receive no support from any source in this ministry of
      yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The evangelist hesitated. "I receive no salary, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No support?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I receive no regular salary," reiterated the evangelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not quibble, sir," said the Rector sternly. "Do you receive any
      financial support from any source whatever in your mission about the
      country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I receive&mdash;" began the evangelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you or do you not?" thundered the Rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was about to say that my expenses are paid by my society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, no more need be said. These people can judge for themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am willing that they should judge, but I remind you that there is
      another Judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," replied the Rector with portentous solemnity, "there is,
      before whom both you and I must stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now then," said the evangelist, taking up the Bible, "we may proceed
      with our meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," replied the Rector, stepping upon the platform. "I will not
      permit it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no right to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have every right to protect this community from heretical and
      disingenuous, not to say dishonest, persons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You call me dishonest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said disingenuous."
    </p>
    <p>
      The evangelist turned toward the audience. "I protest against this
      intrusion upon this meeting. I appeal to the audience for British fair
      play."
    </p>
    <p>
      Murmurs were heard from the audience and subdued signs of approval. The
      Rector glanced upon the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair play," he cried, "you will get as will any man who appears properly
      accredited and properly qualified to proclaim the Gospel, but in the name
      of this Christian community, I will prevent the exploitation of an unwary
      and trusting people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liberty of speech!" called a voice from a dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liberty of speech," roared the Rector. "Who of you wants liberty of
      speech? Let him stand forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a strained and breathless silence. The champion of free
      speech retreated behind his discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I thought so," said the Rector in grim contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he spoke a quiet voice invaded the tense silence like a bell
      in a quiet night. It was Mrs. Gwynne, her slight girlish figure standing
      quietly erect, her face glowing as with an inner light, her eyes resting
      in calm fearlessness upon the Rector's heated countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," she said, "my conscience will not permit me to sit in silence in
      the presence of what I feel to be an infringement of the rights of free
      people. I venture very humbly to protest against this injustice, and to
      say that this gentleman has a right to be heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      An even more intense silence fell upon the people. The Rector stood
      speechless, gazing upon the little woman who had thus broken every
      tradition of the community in lifting her voice in a public assembly and
      who had dared to challenge the authority of one who for nearly twenty
      years had been recognised as the autocrat of the village and of the whole
      countryside. But the Rector was an alert and gallant fighter. He quickly
      recovered his poise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Mrs. Gwynne, our good friend and neighbour, desires to address this
      meeting," he said with a courteous and elaborate bow, "and I am sure by
      training and tradition she is quite capable of doing so, I am confident
      that all of us will be delighted to listen to her. But the question in
      hand is not quite so simple as she imagines. It is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liberty of speech," said the voice again from the dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rector wheeled fiercely in the direction from which the interruption
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who speaks," he cried; "why does he shrink into the darkness? Let him
      come forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again discretion held the interrupter silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for you&mdash;you, sir," continued the Rector, turning upon the
      evangelist, "if you desire&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point there was a sudden commotion from the opposite side of
      the room. A quaint dwarfish figure, crippled but full of vigour, stumped
      up to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son," he said, grandly waving the Rector to one side, "allow me, my
      son. You have done well. Now I shall deal with this gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the misshapen body had a noble head, a face marked with
      intellectual quality, but the glitter in the large blue eye told the same
      tale of mental anarchy. Startled and astonished, the evangelist backed
      away from the extraordinary creature that continued to advance upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," cried the dwarf, "by what right do you proclaim the divine message
      to your fellowmen? Have you known the cross, have you felt the piercing
      crown, do you bear upon your body the mark of the spear?" At this with a
      swift upward hitch of his shirt the dwarf exposed his bare side. The
      evangelist continued to back away from his new assailant, who continued
      vigorously to follow him up. The youngsters in the crowd broke into
      laughter. The scene passed swiftly from tragedy to farce. At this point
      the Rector interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, John," he said, laying a firm, but gentle, hand upon the
      dwarf's shoulder. "That will do now. He is perfectly harmless, sir," he
      said, addressing the evangelist. Then turning to the audience, "I think we
      may dismiss this meeting," and, raising his hands, he pronounced the
      benediction, and the people dispersed in disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strained "Good-night, sir," to the evangelist and a courteous bow
      to Mrs. Gwynne, the Rector followed the people, leaving the evangelist and
      his wife behind packing up their hymn books and organ, their faces only
      too clearly showing the distress which they felt. Mrs. Gwynne moved toward
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am truly grieved," she said, addressing the evangelist, "that you were
      not given an opportunity to deliver your message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a terrible creature that is," he exclaimed in a tone indicating
      nervous anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you mean poor John?" said Mrs. Gwynne. "The poor man is quite
      harmless. He became excited with the unusual character of the meeting. He
      will disturb you no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear it is useless," said the evangelist. "I cannot continue in the
      face of this opposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be difficult, but not useless," replied Mrs. Gwynne, the light of
      battle glowing in her grey eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I do not know. It may not be wise to stir up bad feeling in a
      community, to bring the name of religion into disrepute by strife. But,"
      he continued, offering his hand, "let me thank you warmly for your
      sympathy. It was splendidly courageous of you. Do you&mdash;do you attend
      his church?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we worship with the Episcopal Church. I am a Friend myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then it was a splendidly courageous act. I honour you for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will continue your mission?" she replied earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, I can hardly see how the mission can be continued. There seems to
      be no opening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwynne apparently lost interest. "Good-bye," she said simply, shaking
      hands with them both, and without further words left the room with her
      boy. For some distance they walked together along the dark road in
      silence. Then in an awed voice the boy said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could you do it, mother? You were not a bit afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid of what, the Rector?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the Rector&mdash;but to speak up that way before all the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was hard to speak," said his mother, "very hard, but it was harder to
      keep silent. It did not seem right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy's heart swelled with a new pride in his mother. "Oh, mother," he
      said, "you were splendid. You were like a soldier standing there. You were
      like the martyrs in my book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no, my boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you yes, mother, I was proud of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrilling passion in the little boy's voice went to his mother's
      heart. "Were you, my boy?" she said, her voice faltering. "I am glad you
      were."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand in hand they walked along, the boy exulting in his restored pride in
      his mother and in her courage. But a new feeling soon stirred within him.
      He remembered with a pain intolerable that he had allowed the word of so
      despicable a creature as Mop Cheatley to shake his faith in his mother's
      courage. Indignation at the wretched creature who had maligned her, but
      chiefly a passionate self-contempt that he had allowed himself to doubt
      her, raged tumultuously in his heart and drove him in a silent fury
      through the dark until they reached their own gate. Then as his mother's
      hand reached toward the latch, the boy abruptly caught her arm in a fierce
      grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," he burst forth in a passionate declaration of faith, "you're not
      a coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A coward?" replied his mother, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy's arms went around her, his head pressed into her bosom. In a
      voice broken with passionate sobs he poured forth his tale of shame and
      self-contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said you were a Quaker, that the Quakers were cowards, and would never
      fight, and that you were a coward, and that you would never fight. But you
      would, mother, wouldn't you? And you're not a real Quaker, are you,
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Quaker," said his mother. "Yes, dear, I belong to the Friends, as we
      call them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they, won't they ever fight?" demanded the boy anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do not believe that fighting with fists, or sticks, or like wild
      beasts," said his mother, "ever wins anything worth while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, mother?" cried the boy, anxiety and fear in his tones. "You would
      fight, you would fight to-night, you would fight the Rector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my boy," said his mother quietly, "that kind of fighting we believe
      in. Our people have never been afraid to stand up for the right, and to
      suffer for it too. Remember that, my boy," a certain pride rang out in the
      mother's voice. She continued, "We must never be afraid to suffer for what
      we believe to be right. You must never forget that through all your life,
      Larry." Her voice grew solemn. "You must never, never go back from what
      you know to be right, even if you have to suffer for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother," whispered the boy through his sobs, "I wish I were brave
      like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not like me," whispered his mother, putting her face down to his.
      "You will be much braver than your mother, my boy, oh, very much braver
      than your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy still clung to her as if he feared to let her go. "Oh, mother," he
      whispered, "do you think I can be brave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my boy," her voice rang out again confident and clear. "It always
      makes us brave to know that He bore the cross for us and died rather than
      betray us."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no more words between them, but the memory of that night never
      faded from the boy's mind. A new standard of heroism was set up within his
      soul which he might fail to reach but which he could never lower.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ESCUTCHEON CLEARED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Michael Gwynne, the Mapleton storekeeper, was undoubtedly the most
      popular man not in the village only but in the whole township. To begin
      with he was a man of high character, which was sufficiently guaranteed by
      the fact that he was chosen as Rector's Warden in All Saints Episcopal
      Church. He was moreover the Rector's right-hand man, ready to back up any
      good cause with personal effort, with a purse always open but not often
      full, and with a tongue that was irresistible, for he had to an
      extraordinary degree the gift of persuasive speech. Therefore, the
      Rector's first move in launching any new scheme was to secure the approval
      and co-operation of his Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the whole community too Mr. Gwynne was recognised as a gentleman, a
      gentleman not in appearance and bearing only, a type calculated to repel
      plain folk, but a gentleman in heart, with a charm of manner which
      proceeded from a real interest in and consideration for the welfare of
      others. This charm of manner proved a valuable asset to him in his
      business, for behind his counter Mr. Gwynne had a rare gift of investing
      the very calicoes and muslins which he displayed before the dazzled eyes
      of the ladies who came to buy with a glamour that never failed to make
      them appear altogether desirable; and even the hard-headed farmers fell
      under this spell of his whether he described to them the superexcellent
      qualities of a newly patented cream separator or the virtues of a new
      patent medicine for ailing horses whose real complaint was overwork or
      underfeeding. With all this, moreover, Mr. Gwynne was rigidly honest. No
      one ever thought of disputing an account whether he paid it or not, and
      truth demands that with Mr. Gwynne's customers the latter course was more
      frequently adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Mr. Gwynne failed of success as a business man.
      He could buy with discrimination, he had a rare gift of salesmanship, but
      as a collector, in the words of Sam Cheatley, the village butcher, himself
      a conspicuous star in that department of business activity, "He was not
      worth a tinker's curse." His accounts were sent out punctually twice a
      year. His wife saw to that. At times of desperation when pressure from the
      wholesale houses became urgent, special statements were sent out by Mr.
      Gwynne himself. But in such cases the apology accompanying these
      statements was frequently such as to make immediate payment seem almost an
      insult. His customers held him in high esteem, respected his intellectual
      ability&mdash;for he was a Trinity man&mdash;were fascinated by his charm
      of manner, loved him for his kindly qualities, but would not pay their
      bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years ago, having failed to work harmoniously with his business
      partner, a shrewd, hard-headed, Belfast draper&mdash;hard-hearted Mr.
      Gwynne considered him&mdash;Mr. Gwynne had decided to emigrate to Canada
      with the remnant of a small fortune which was found to be just sufficient
      to purchase the Mapleton general store, and with it a small farm of fifty
      acres on the corner of which the store stood. It was the farm that decided
      the investment; for Mr. Gwynne was possessed of the town man's infatuation
      for farm life and of the optimistic conviction that on the farm a living
      at least for himself and his small family would be assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his years of business in Mapleton had gradually exhausted his fortune
      and accumulated a staggering load of debt which was the occasion of
      moments of anxiety, even of fear, to the storekeeper. There was always the
      thought in his mind that against his indebtedness on the credit side there
      were his book accounts which ran up into big figures. There was always, if
      the worst came to the worst, the farm. But if Mr. Gwynne was no business
      man still less was he a farmer. Tied to his store by reason of his
      inability to afford a competent assistant, the farming operations were
      carried on in haphazard fashion by neighbours who were willing to
      liquidate their store debts with odd days' work at times most convenient
      to themselves, but not always most seasonable for the crops. Hence in good
      years, none too good with such haphazard farming, the farm was called upon
      to make up the deficiency in the financial returns of the store. In bad
      years notes had to be renewed with formidable accumulations of interest.
      But such was Mr. Gwynne's invincible optimism that he met every new
      embarrassment with some new project giving new promise of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile during these painful years his brave little wife by her garden
      and her poultry materially helped to keep the family in food and to meet
      in some degree the household expenses. She was her own servant except that
      the Widow Martin came to her aid twice a week. Her skill with needle and
      sewing machine and a certain creative genius which she possessed enabled
      her to evolve from her husband's old clothes new clothes for her boy, and
      from her own clothing, when not too utterly worn, dresses for her two
      little girls. And throughout these years with all their toil and anxiety
      she met each day with a spirit undaunted and with a face that remained
      serene as far at least as her husband and her children ever saw. Nor did
      she allow the whole weight of trials to taint the sweetness of her spirit
      or to dim her faith in God. Devoted to her husband, she refused to allow
      herself to criticise his business ability or methods. The failure, which
      she could not but admit, was not his fault; it was the fault of those
      debtors who declined to pay their just dues.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour of desperation she ventured to point out to her husband that
      these farmers were extending their holdings and buying machinery with
      notes that bore interest. "And besides, Michael," she said, "Lawrence must
      go to High School next year. He will pass the Entrance examination this
      summer, and he must go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shall go," said her husband. "I am resolved to make a change in my
      method of business. I shall go after these men. They shall no longer use
      my money for their business and for their families while my business and
      my family suffer. You need not look that way, I have made up my mind and I
      shall begin at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the season was not suitable for collections. The farmers
      were engrossed with their harvesting, and after that with the fall
      ploughing, and later with the marketing of their grain. And as the weeks
      passed Mr. Gwynne's indignant resolve that his customers should not do
      business on his money gradually cooled down. The accounts were sent out as
      usual, and with the usual disappointing result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mr. Gwynne's attention was diverted from his delinquent debtors
      by an enterprise which to an unusual degree awakened his sympathy and
      kindled his imagination. The Reverend Heber Harding, ever since his
      unfortunate encounter with the travelling evangelist, was haunted with the
      uneasy feeling that he and his church were not completely fulfilling their
      functions in the community and justifying their existence. The impression
      had been the more painfully deepened in him by the sudden eruption of a
      spirit of recklessness and a certain tendency to general lawlessness in
      some of the young men of the village. As a result of a conference with the
      leading men of his congregation, he had decided to organise a young men's
      club. The business of setting this club in active operation was handed
      over to Mr. Gwynne, than whom no one in the village was better fitted for
      the work. The project appealed to Mr. Gwynne's imagination. A room was
      secured in the disused Orange Hall. Subscriptions were received to make
      purchase of apparatus and equipment necessary for games of various sorts.
      With vivid remembrance of his college days, Mr. Gwynne saw to it that as
      part of the equipment a place should be found for a number of sets of
      boxing gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those who were not too sure of the uplifting influence of the
      boxing gloves. But after Mr. Gwynne had given an exhibition of the
      superior advantages of science over brute force in a bout with Mack
      Morrison before a crowded hall, whatever doubt might exist as to the
      ethical value of the boxing gloves, there was no doubt at all as to their
      value as an attractive force in the building up of the membership of the
      Young Men's Club. The boxing class became immensely popular, and being
      conducted under Mr. Gwynne's most rigid supervision, it gradually came to
      exert a most salutary influence upon its members. They learned, for one
      thing, to take hard knocks without losing their tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the boxing class thus established, none showed a greater eagerness to
      learn than did Larry. Every moment of his father's spare time he utilised
      to add to his knowledge of the various feints and guards and cuts and
      punches and hooks that appeared necessary to a scientific acquaintance
      with the manly art. He developed an amazing capacity to accept punishment.
      Indeed, he appeared almost to welcome rough handling, especially from the
      young men and boys bigger than himself. Light in weight and not very
      muscular, he was wiry and quick in eye and in action, and under his
      father's teaching he learned how to "make his heels save his head." He was
      always ready for a go with any one who might offer, and when all others
      had wearied of the sport Larry would put in an extra half hour with the
      punching bag. With one boy only he refused to spar. No persuasion, no
      taunts, no challenge could entice him to put on the gloves with Mop
      Cheatley. He could never look steadily at Mop for any length of time
      without seeing again on his face the sneering grin and hearing again the
      terrible words spoken two years ago in the cedar woods behind the mill
      pond: "You're a coward and your mother's a coward before you." He refused
      to spar with Mop for he knew that once face to face with him he could not
      spar, he must fight. But circumstances made the contest inevitable. In the
      working out of a tournament, it chanced that Mop was drawn to face Larry,
      and although the disparity both in age and weight seemed to handicap the
      smaller boy to an excessive degree, Larry's friends who were arranging the
      schedule, among them Mack Morrison with big Ben Hopper and Joe Gagneau as
      chorus, and who knew something of Larry's skill with his hands and speed
      on his feet, were not unwilling to allow the draw to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days preceding the tournament were days of misery for Larry. The
      decision in the contest would of course be on points and he knew that he
      could outpoint without much difficulty his antagonist who was clumsy and
      slow. For the decision Larry cared nothing at all. At the most he had
      little to lose for it would be but small disgrace to be beaten by a boy so
      much bigger. The cause of his distress was something quite other than
      this. He knew that from the first moment of the bout he would be fighting.
      That this undoubtedly would make Mop fight back, and he was haunted by the
      fear that in the stress of battle he might play the coward. Would he be
      able to stand up to Mop when the fight began to go against him? And
      suppose he should run away, should show himself a coward? How could he
      ever live after that, how look any of the boys in the face? Worst of all,
      how could he face his father, whose approval in this boxing game since he
      had revealed himself as a "fighting man" the boy coveted more than
      anything else. But his father was not present when the boy stepped into
      the ring. Impelled by the dread of showing himself a coward and running
      away, Larry flung to the winds his father's favourite maxim, "Let your
      heels save your head," a maxim which ought if ever to be observed in such
      a bout as this in which he was so out-classed in weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word "Time" Larry leaped for his opponent and almost before Mop was
      aware that the battle had begun he was being blinded, staggered and beaten
      all around the ring, and only a lucky blow, flung wildly into space and
      landing heavily upon Larry's face, saved him from complete defeat in the
      first round. That single heavy blow was sufficient to give temporary pause
      to Larry's impetuosity, but as soon as he got back his wind he once more
      ran in, feinting, ducking, plunging, but ever pressing hard upon his
      antagonist, who, having recovered from his first surprise, began to plant
      heavy blows upon Larry's ribs, until at the end of the round the boy was
      glad enough to sink back into his corner gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Hopper, who was acting as Larry's second, was filled with surprise and
      indignation at his principal's fighting tactics. "You blame fool," he said
      to Larry as he ministered to his all too apparent necessities. "What do
      you think you're doing? Do you think he's a sausage machine and you a
      bloody porker? Keep away from him. You know he's too heavy for you. If he
      were not so clumsy he would have had you out before this. One good punch
      from him would do it. Why don't you do your foot work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corec," said Joe. "Larree, you fight all the same Mack Morrison's ram.
      Head down, jump in&mdash;head down, jump in. Why you run so queek on dat
      Mop feller? Why you not make him run after you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's right, Larry," said Ben. "Use your feet; make him come after you.
      You will sure get his wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Larry stood recovering his breath, glowering meanwhile at his enemy
      across the ring. He neither heeded nor heard the entreaties of his
      friends. In his ears one phrase only rang with insistent reiteration.
      "He's a coward, an' his mother's a coward before him." Only one obsession
      possessed him, he must keep hard at his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time!" The second round was on. Like a tiger upon his prey, Larry was
      upon his foe, driving fast and furious blows upon his head and face. But
      this time Mop was ready for him, and bearing in, head down, he took on his
      left guard the driving blows with no apparent injury, and sent back some
      half a dozen heavy swings that broke down Larry's guard, drove him across
      the ring and finally brought him gasping to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay where you are," yelled Ben. "Take your count, Larry, and keep away
      from him. Do you hear me? Keep away, always away."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the ninth count Larry sprang to his feet, easily eluded Mop's swinging
      blow, and slipping lightly around the ring, escaped further attack until
      he had picked up his wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the game," yelled Ben. "Keep it up, old boy, keep it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "C'est bon stuff, Larree," yelled Joe, dancing wildly in Ben's corner.
      "C'est bon stuff, Larree, for sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      But once more master of his wind, Larry renewed his battering assault upon
      Mop's head, inflicting some damage indeed, but receiving heavy punishment
      in return. The close of the round found him exhausted and bleeding. In
      spite of the adjurations and entreaties of his friends, Larry pursued the
      same tactics in the third round, which ended even more disastrously than
      the second. His condition was serious enough to bring Mack Morrison to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's up with you, Larry?" said Mack. "Where's your science gone? Why
      don't you play the game as you know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mack, Mack," panted Larry. "It ain't a game. I'm&mdash;I'm fighting, and,
      Mack, I'm not afraid of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mack whistled. "Who said you are afraid of him, youngster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did, Mack, he called me a coward&mdash;you remember, Ben, up in the
      cedar bush that day we played hookey&mdash;you remember, Ben?" Ben nodded.
      "He called me a coward and"&mdash;grinding the words between his teeth&mdash;"he
      called my mother a coward. But I am not afraid of him, Mack&mdash;he can't
      make me afraid; he can't make me run away." What with his rage and his
      secret fear, the boy had quite lost control of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's it," said Mack, reading both rage and fear in his eyes. "Listen
      to me, Larry," he continued in a voice low and stern. "You quit this
      monkey work right now or, by the jumping Jehoshaphat, I will lick the tar
      out of you myself when this is over. You're not afraid of him; I know that&mdash;we
      all know that. But you don't want to kill him, eh? No. What you want is to
      make him look like a fool. Well, then, fight, if you want to fight, but
      remember your rules. Play with him, make him follow you round until you
      get his wind; there's your chance. Then get him hard and get away."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy spoke no word in reply. He was staring gloomily, desperately,
      before him into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mack seized him, and shaking him impatiently, said, "Larry boy, listen to
      me. Don't you care for anybody but yourself? Don't you care for me at
      all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Larry appeared to wake up as from a sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, Mack?" he answered. "Of course I care, you know that,
      Mack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Mack, "for God's sake, get a smile on your face. Smile,
      confound you, smile."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy passed his gloved hand over his face, looked for a moment into
      Mack's eyes, and the old smile came back to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you're all right," cried Mack in triumph. "Remember your father's
      rule, 'Keep your head with your heels.'" And Larry did remember! For on
      the call of "Time" he slipped from Ben's knees and began to circle lightly
      about Mop, smiling upon him and waiting his chance. His chance soon came,
      for Mop, thinking that his enemy had had about enough and was ready to
      quit, adopted aggressive tactics, and, feinting with his right, swung
      heavily with his left at the smiling face. But the face proved elusive,
      and upon Mop's undefended head a series of blows dealt with savage fury
      took all the heart out of him. So he cried to the referee as he ducked
      into his corner:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's fightin'. He's fightin'. I'm not fightin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better get busy then," called Ben derisively from his corner. "Now,
      Larry, sail into him," and Larry sailed in with such vehemence that Mop
      fairly turned tail and ran around the ring, Larry pursuing him amid the
      delighted shouts of the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ended the contest, the judges giving the decision to Mop, who, though
      obviously beaten at the finish, had showed a distinct superiority on
      points. As for Larry, the decision grieved him not at all. He carried home
      a face slightly disfigured but triumphant, his sole comment to his mother
      upon the contest being, "I was not afraid of him anyway, mother; he could
      not make me run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not so sure of this boxing, Lawrence," she said, but the boy caught
      the glint in her eyes and was well enough content.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late evening Ben, with Larry and Joe following him, took occasion
      to look in upon Mop at the butcher shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Mop," said Ben pleasantly, "what do you think of Larry now? Would
      you say he was a coward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" asked Mop, suspecting trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what I say," said Ben, while Larry moved up within range, his face
      white, his eyes gleaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't saying nothing about nobody," replied Mop sullenly, with the tail
      of his eye upon Larry's white face and gleaming eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say him one tam&mdash;in de cedar swamp," said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you say Larry was a coward?" repeated Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I wouldn't say nothing of the sort," replied Mop promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think he is a coward?" persisted Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mop, "I know he ain't no coward. He don't fight like no
      coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeared to satisfy Ben, but Larry, moving slightly nearer, took up
      the word for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would you say my mother was a coward?" he asked in a tense voice, his
      body gathered as if for a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry, I wouldn't say nothing about your mother," replied Mop earnestly.
      "I think your mother's a bully good woman. She was awfully good to my
      mother last winter, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring went out of Larry's body. He backed away from Mop and the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who said your mother was a coward?" inquired Mop indignantly. "If anybody
      says so, you bring him to me, and I'll punch his head good, I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry looked foolishly at Ben, who looked foolishly back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Mop," said Larry, a smile like a warm light passing over his face,
      "come on up and see my new rabbits."

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SALVAGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another and greater enterprise was diverting Mr. Gwynne's attention from
      the delinquencies of his debtors, namely: the entrance of the National
      Machine Company into the remote and placid life of Mapleton and its
      district. The manager of this company, having spent an afternoon with Mr.
      Gwynne in his store and having been impressed by his charm and power of
      persuasive talk, made him a proposition that he should act as agent of the
      National Machine Company. The arrangement suggested was one that appealed
      to Mr. Gwynne's highly optimistic temperament. He was not to work for a
      mere salary, but was to purchase outright the various productions of the
      National Machine Company and receive a commission upon all his sales. The
      figures placed before Mr. Gwynne by the manager of the company were
      sufficiently impressive, indeed so impressive that Mr. Gwynne at once
      accepted the proposition, and the Mapleton branch of the National Machine
      Company became an established fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer any question as to the education of his family. In
      another year when his boy had passed his entrance examinations he would be
      able to send him to the high school in the neighbouring town of Easton,
      properly equipped and relieved of those handicaps with which poverty can
      so easily wash all the colour out of young life. A brilliant picture the
      father drew before the eyes of his wife of the educational career of their
      boy, who had already given promise of exceptional ability. But while she
      listened, charmed, delighted and filled with proud anticipation, the
      mother with none the less painful care saved her garden and poultry money,
      cut to bare necessity her household expenses, skimped herself and her
      children in the matter of dress, and by every device which she had learned
      in the bitter school of experience during the ten years of her Canadian
      life, made such preparation for the expenses of her boy's education as
      would render it unnecessary to call upon the wealth realised from the
      National Machine Company's business.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of providing for the expense of his education Larry himself
      began to take a not unimportant part. During the past two years he had
      gained not only in size but in the vigour of his health, and in almost
      every kind of work on the farm he could now take a man's place. His mother
      would not permit him to give his time and strength to their own farming
      operations for the sufficient reason that from these there would be no
      return in ready money, and ready money was absolutely essential to the
      success of her plans. The boy was quick, eager and well-mannered, and in
      consequence had no difficulty in finding employment with the neighbouring
      farmers. So much was this the case that long before the closing of school
      in the early summer Larry was offered work for the whole summer by their
      neighbour, Mr. Martin, at one dollar a day. He could hardly believe his
      good fortune inasmuch as he had never in all his life been paid at a rate
      exceeding half that amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have a lot of money, mother," he said, "for my high school now. I
      wonder how much it will cost me for the term."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon his mother seized the opportunity to discuss the problem with
      him which she knew they must face together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us see," said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then each with pencil and paper they drew up to the table, but after the
      most careful paring down of expenses and the most optimistic estimate of
      their resources consistent with fact, they made the rather discouraging
      discovery that they were still fifty dollars short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do it, mother," said Larry, in bitter disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall not give up yet," said his mother. "Indeed, I think with what we
      can make out of the farm and garden and poultry, we ought to be able to
      manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      But a new and chilling thought had come to the lad. He pondered silently,
      and as he pondered his face became heavily shadowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, mother," he said suddenly, "we can't do it. How much are you going
      to spend on your clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I need," said his mother brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much did you spend last year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind, Lawrence; that really does not matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy insisted. "Did you spend thirty-one dollars?" His mother
      laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you spend twenty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you spend fifteen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," said his mother, "and I am not going to talk about it. My
      clothes and the girls' clothes will be all right for this year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said Larry, "I am not going to school this year. I am not going
      to spend thirty-one dollars for clothes while you and the girls spend
      nothing. I am going to work first, and then go to school. I am not going
      to school this year." The boy rose from his chair and stood and faced his
      mother with quivering lips, fighting to keep back the tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother reached out her hand and drew him toward her. "My darling boy," she
      said in a low voice, "I love to hear you, but listen to me. Are you
      listening? You must be educated. Nothing must interfere with that. No
      suffering is too great to be endured by all of us. The time for education
      is youth; first because your mind works more quickly and retains better
      what it acquires, and second because it is a better investment, and you
      will sooner be able to pay us all back what we spend now. So you will go
      to school this year, boy, if we can manage it, and I think we can. Some
      day," she added, patting him on the shoulder, and holding him off from
      her, "when you are rich you will give me a silk dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't I just," cried the boy passionately, "and the girls too, and
      everything you want, and I will give you a good time yet, mother. You
      deserve the best a woman ever had and I will give it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother turned her face away from him and looked out of the window. She
      saw not the fields of growing grain but a long vista of happy days ever
      growing in beauty and in glory until she could see no more for the tears
      that quietly fell. The boy dropped on his knees beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother, mother," he said. "You have been wonderful to us all, and you
      have had an awfully hard time. A fellow never knows, does he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hard time? A hard time?" said his mother, a great surprise in her voice
      and in her face. "No, my boy, no hard time for me. A dear, dear, lovely
      time with you all, every day, every day. Never do I want a better time
      than I have had with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The event proved the wisdom of Mrs. Gwynne's determination to put little
      faith in the optimistic confidence of her husband in regard to the profits
      to be expected from the operations of the National Machine Company. A
      year's business was sufficient to demonstrate that the Mapleton branch of
      the National Machine Company was bankrupt. By every law of life it ought
      to be bankrupt. With all his many excellent qualities Mr. Gwynne possessed
      certain fatal defects as a business man. With him the supreme
      consideration was simply the getting rid of the machines purchased by him
      as rapidly and in such large numbers as possible. He cheerfully ignored
      the laws that governed the elemental item of profit. Hence the relentless
      Nemesis that sooner or later overtakes those who, whether ignorantly or
      maliciously, break laws, fell upon the National Machine Company and upon
      those who had the misfortune to be associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wreck of the business Mr. Gwynne's store, upon which the National
      Machine Company had taken the precaution to secure a mortgage, was also
      involved. The business went into the hands of a receiver and was bought up
      at about fifty cents on the dollar by a man recently from western Canada
      whose specialty was the handling of business wreckage. No one after even a
      cursory glance at his face would suspect Mr. H. P. Sleighter of deficiency
      in business qualities. The snap in the cold grey eye, the firm lines in
      the long jaw, the thin lips pressed hard together, all proclaimed the
      hard-headed, cold-hearted, iron-willed man of business. Mr. Sleighter,
      moreover, had a remarkable instinct for values, more especially for
      salvage values. It was this instinct that led him to the purchase of the
      National Machine Company wreckage, which included as well the Mapleton
      general store, with its assets in stock and book debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter's methods with the easy-going debtors of the company in
      Mapleton and the surrounding district were of such galvanic vigour that
      even so practiced a procrastinator as Farmer Martin found himself actually
      drawing money from his hoarded bank account to pay his store debts&mdash;a
      thing unheard of in that community&mdash;and to meet overdue payments upon
      the various implements which he had purchased from the National Machine
      Company. It was not until after the money had been drawn and actually paid
      that Mr. Martin came fully to realise the extraordinary nature of his act.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there feller," he said, looking from the receipt in his hand to the
      store door through which the form of Mr. Sleighter had just vanished,
      "that there feller, he's too swift fer me. He ain't got any innards to
      speak of; he'd steal the pants off a dog, he would."
    </p>
    <p>
      The application of these same galvanically vigorous methods to Mr.
      Gwynne's debtors produced surprising results. Mr. Sleighter made the
      astounding discovery that Mr. Gwynne's business instead of being bankrupt
      would produce not only one hundred cents on the dollar, but a slight
      profit as well. This discovery annoyed Mr. Sleighter. He hated to confess
      a mistake in business judgment, and he frankly confessed he "hated to see
      good money roll past him." Hence with something of a grudge he prepared to
      hand over to Mr. Gwynne some twelve hundred and fifty dollars of salvage
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he will be selling out his farm," said Mr. Sleighter in
      conversation with Mr. Martin. "What's land worth about here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, somewhere about a hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred dollars an acre!" exclaimed Mr. Sleighter. "Don't try to put
      anything over on me. Personally I admire your generous, kindly nature, but
      as a financial adviser you don't shine. I guess I won't bother about that
      farm anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter's question awakened earnest thought in Mr. Martin, and the
      next morning he approached Mr. Gwynne with a proposition to purchase his
      farm with its attached buildings. Mr. Martin made it clear that he was
      chiefly anxious to do a neighbourly turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The house and the stable ain't worth much," he said, "but the farm bein'
      handy to my property, I own up is worth more to me than to other folks,
      perhaps. So bein' old neighbours, I am willin' to give four thousand
      dollars, half cash down, for the hull business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely that is a low figure," said Mr. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Low figure!" exclaimed Mr. Martin. "All right, I ain't pressin' it on
      you; but if you could get any one in this neighbourhood to offer four
      thousand dollars for your farm, I will give you five hundred extra. But,"
      he continued, "I ain't pressin' you. Don't much matter to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The offer came at a psychologically critical moment, when Mr. Gwynne was
      desperately seeking escape from an intolerable environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall consult Mrs. Gwynne," he said, "and let you know in a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know as I can wait that long," said Mr. Martin. "I made the offer
      to oblige you, and besides I got a chance at the Monroe fifty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call to-morrow night," said Mr. Gwynne, and carried the proposal home to
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion to break up her home to a woman of Mrs. Gwynne's type is
      almost shattering. In the big world full of nameless terrors the one spot
      offering shelter and safety for herself and her family was her home. But
      after all, her husband was her great concern, and she could see he was
      eager for the change. She made up her mind to the sacrifice and decided
      that she would break up the home in Mapleton and with her husband try
      again their fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But four thousand dollars," she said, "is surely a small price."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Small? I know it is small, but Martin knows I am in a corner. He is a
      highway robber."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bitter experience for him to be forced to confess himself a
      business failure, and with this bitterness there mingled a feeling of
      hostility toward all successful business men. To him it seemed that in
      order to win success in business a man must become, like Mr. Martin, a
      highway robber. In this mood of bitterness and hostility toward successful
      men, Mr. Sleighter found him the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't find you at the store," said that gentleman, walking in with his
      hat on his head. "I wanted to get this business straightened up, so I just
      came in. Won't take more than five minutes. I guess you won't mind taking
      a little check from me. Your business turned out better than that fool of
      an assignee thought. Don't hurt me any, of course. I got all that was
      comin' to me out of it, but here's this check. Perhaps you'll sign the
      receipt. I guess they been puttin' it over you all right. You're a little
      too soft with 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gwynne was an even-tempered man, but Mr. Sleighter's patronising
      manner and his criticism of his business ability wrought in him a rage
      that he could with difficulty control. He remembered he was in his own
      house, however, and that the man before him was a stranger. While he was
      searching for pen and ink the door opened and his wife entered the room.
      Mr. Sleighter, with his hat still upon his head, was intently gazing out
      of the window, easily rocking on the two hind legs of the chair. The door
      opened behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said Mr. Gwynne, "will you excuse me? I am engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I beg your pardon, I didn't know any one was here. I merely wanted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter glanced over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Sleighter," said Mr. Gwynne. "My wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not his tone, however, that brought Mr. Sleighter hurriedly to his
      feet with his hat in his hand. It was something in the bearing of the
      little lady standing behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleased to meet you, ma'am. I hope you are well," he said, bowing
      elaborately before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you very much, I am quite well. I have heard a great deal about
      you, Mr. Sleighter. I am glad to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter held her hand a moment while her eyes rested quietly and
      kindly, if searchingly, upon his face. This was the man who had profited
      by her husband's loss. Was he too a highway robber? Mr. Sleighter somehow
      felt as if his soul were being exposed to a searchlight. It made him
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a fine day, ma'am," he remarked, seeking cover for his soul in
      conversation. "A little warm for the time," he continued, wiping his
      forehead with a highly coloured silk handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you sit down, Mr. Sleighter? Do you find it warm? I thought there
      was quite a chilly wind to-day. But then you are more accustomed to the
      wind than I."
    </p>
    <p>
      The searching eyes were holding him steadily, but the face was kindly and
      full of genuine interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess so," he said with a little laugh. He would have scorned to
      acknowledge that his laugh was nervous and thin. "I come from the windy
      side of the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am from out West&mdash;Alberta. We have got all the winds there is
      and the Chinook besides for a change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alberta? The Chinook?" The eyes became less searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's the wind that comes down from the mountains and licks up the
      snow at ten miles an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was an Alberta man, you know, who invented a rig with runners in front
      and wheels behind." The lady was bewildered. "To catch up with the
      Chinook, you see. One of my kid's jokes. Not much of a joke I guess, but
      he's always ringin' 'em in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a son, Mr. Sleighter? He's in Alberta now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the missis and the kids, three of them, are in Winnipeg. She got
      tired of it out there; she was always wantin' the city, so I gave in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear it's a beautiful country out there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you're talkin', ma'am." She had touched Mr. Sleighter's favourite
      theme. Indeed, the absorbing passion of his life, next to the picking up
      of good salvage bargains, was his home in the Foothill country of the
      West.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was engaged in an enthusiastic description of the glories of that
      wonderland the children came in and were presented. Mr. Gwynne handed his
      visitor his receipt and stood suggestively awaiting his departure. But Mr.
      Sleighter was fairly started on his subject and was not to be denied. The
      little girls drew shyly near him with eyes aglow while Mr. Sleighter's
      words roiled forth like a mountain flood. Eloquently he described the
      beauty of the rolling lands, the splendour of the mountains, the richness
      of the soil, the health-giving qualities of the climate, the warm-hearted
      hospitality of the settlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of your pin-head two-by-four shysters that you see here in the
      East," exclaimed Mr. Sleighter. "I mean some folks, of course," he
      explained in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the children, did they like it?" inquired Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet they did. Why, they was all over the hull prairie, all day and
      all night, too, mostly&mdash;on ponies you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ponies!" exclaimed Larry. "Did they have ponies? Could they ride? How big
      are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How big? Blamed if I know. Let's see. There's Tom. He's just about a man,
      or thinks he is. He's sixteen or seventeen. Just now he's in the high
      school at Winnipeg. He don't like it though." Here a shadow fell on Mr.
      Sleighter's face. "And the girls&mdash;there's Hazel, she's fifteen, and
      Ethel Mary, she's eleven or somewhere thereabouts. I never can keep track
      of them. They keep againin' on me all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mrs. Gwynne. "It is hard to realise that they are growing up
      and will soon be away from us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," said Mr. Sleighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the schools," continued Mrs. Gwynne, "are there good schools?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Schools?" exclaimed Mr. Sleighter. "There's a real good school not more
      than a couple of miles away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two miles," exclaimed the mother aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's nothin'. They ride, of course. But we ain't got much of a
      master now. He's rather&mdash;you know." Mr. Sleighter significantly
      tipped up with his little finger and winked toward Mr. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you love that country," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I love it and I hated to leave it. But the missis never liked it.
      She was city born and bred. She wanted the lights, I guess, and the shows.
      I don't blame her, though," he continued rapidly. "It's kind of lonely for
      women, you know. They've got to have amusements and things. But it's God's
      own country, believe me, and I would go back to-morrow, if I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You still own your ranch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; can't sell easily. You see there's not much broke on it&mdash;only a
      hundred acres or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, how big is the ranch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five hundred acres and a wood lot. I did not farm much, though&mdash;mostly
      cattle and horses. I was away a good deal on the trail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trail?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, buying cattle and selling again. That was the worst of it. I am not
      much of a farmer, though farming's all right there, and I was away almost
      all of the time. I guess that made it pretty hard for the missis and the
      kids."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the Widow Martin came in to lay the table for tea. Mr.
      Sleighter took the hint and rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do us the pleasure of staying for tea, Mr. Sleighter?" said Mrs.
      Gwynne earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do," said the youngest little girl, Nora, whose snapping black eyes
      gleamed with eager desire to hear more of the wonderful western land.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do, and tell us more," said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will be able to stay," continued Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter glanced at her husband. "Why, certainly," said Mr. Gwynne,
      "we would be glad to have you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr. Sleighter hesitated. "Say, I don't know what's come over me. I
      feel as if I had been on the stump," he said in an embarrassed voice. "I
      ain't talked to a soul about that country since I left. I guess I got
      pretty full, and when you pulled the cork, out she come."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the tea hour Mrs. Gwynne tried to draw her visitor out to talk
      about his family, but here she failed. Indeed a restraint appeared to fall
      upon him that nothing could dispel. Immediately after tea Mrs. Gwynne
      placed the Bible and Book of Prayers on the table, saying, "We follow the
      custom of reading prayers every evening after tea, Mr. Sleighter. We shall
      be glad to have you join us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing, ma'am," said Mr. Sleighter, pushing back his chair and
      beginning to rock on its hind legs, picking his teeth with his pen knife,
      to the staring horror of the little girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading was from the Scripture to which throughout the centuries the
      Christian Church has gone for authority and guidance in the exercise of
      charity and in the performance of social service, the story of the
      Samaritan gentleman to whom the unhappy traveller whose misfortune it was
      to be sorely mishandled by thieves owed his rescue and his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the reading Mr. Sleighter paid the strictest attention and
      joined in the prayers with every sign of reverence. At the close he stood
      awkwardly shifting from one foot to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll be goin'," he said. "Don't know how you roped me in for this
      here visit, ma'am. I ain't et in any one's house since I left home, and I
      ain't heard any family prayers since my old dad had 'em&mdash;a regular
      old Methodist exhorter he was. He used to pray until all was blue, though
      most times, specially at night, I used to fall asleep. He was great on
      religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose he was any the worse for that," said Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a mite, not a mite, ma'am. A little strict, but straight as a string,
      ma'am. No one could say anythin' against Hiram Sleighter&mdash;H. P.
      Sleighter. I was named for him. He used to pray to beat creation, and then
      some, but he was a straight man all right. And to-night your kids and your
      family prayers made me think of them old days. Well, good-night and thank
      you for the good time you gave me. Best I've had in a dog's age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will come again, Mr. Sleighter," said Mrs. Gwynne, giving him her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and tell us more about that new country," added her son. "My, I'd
      like to go out there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a wonderful country all right and you might do a hull lot worse."
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WESTWARD HO!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Gwynne accompanied Mr. Sleighter to the door. "Will you walk down to
      the store?" said Mr. Sleighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Mr. Gwynne, setting off with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter evidently had something on his mind. The usual fountain of
      his speech seemed to be dried up. As they drew near to the store, he
      seized Mr. Gwynne by the arm, arrested him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Mr. Gwynne, you ain't got any right to be in business. You ain't got
      the parts, and that Machine Company and the rest of 'em put it all over
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We needn't go into that now, I suppose," said Mr. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I guess I am buttin' in&mdash;a thing I don't often do&mdash;but I am
      off my stride to-night anyway, and I am doin' what I never did in all my
      life before. I guess it was them kids of yours and your missis. I know it
      ain't my business, but what are you goin' to do with yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know yet," replied Mr. Gwynne, declining to be confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not goin' into business, I hope. You ain't got the parts. Some people
      ain't got 'em, and you ain't. Goin' to farm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think not. The fact is I'm about selling my farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Selling it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I had an offer to-day which I am thinking of accepting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An offer, eh, from a feller named Martin, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I just figgered. Offered you about a hundred dollars, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I wish he had. It's worth a hundred with the house and buildings&mdash;they
      are good buildings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, I don't like to butt in on any man's business, but is the price a
      secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; he offers four thousand, half cash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how much for the buildings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four thousand for everything, it's not enough but there are not many
      buyers in this neighbourhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, there's nothing rash about that feller. When do you close?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must close to-morrow night. He has a chance of another place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he has, eh? Big rush on, eh? Well, don't you close until I see you
      some time to-morrow, partner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter scented another salvage deal, his keen eyes gleamed a bit,
      the firm lips were pressed a little more closely together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And say," he said, turning back, "I don't wonder you can't do business. I
      couldn't do anything myself with a missis like yours. I couldn't get any
      smooth work over with her lookin' at me like that, durned if I could.
      Well, good-night; see you to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter spent the early hours of the following day among the farmers
      with whom his salvage deal had brought him into contact. The wrecker's
      instinct was strong in him, and besides he regarded with abhorrence the
      tactics of Mr. Martin and welcomed an opportunity to beat that gentleman
      at his own game. He could easily outbid the Martin offer and still buy the
      farm at a low price. As a result of his inquiries he had made up his mind
      that the land was worth at the very least eighty dollars an acre and the
      buildings at least two thousand more. Five thousand would be a
      ridiculously low figure and six thousand not extravagantly high for both
      buildings and farm. The farm with the store and machine business attached
      might offer a fair opening to his son, who was already weary of school and
      anxious to engage in business for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess I'll take a whirl out of the old boy," he said to himself. "He's a
      durn fool anyway and if I don't get his money some one else will."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he made his way to the store. "Boss ain't in?" he
      inquired of the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he's at the house, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know. Guess he's busy over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen Mr. Martin around?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he was here a while ago. Said he would be in again later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter greatly disliked the idea of doing business with Mr. Gwynne
      at his own house. "Can't do no business with his missis and kids around,"
      he said to himself. "Can't get no action with that woman lookin' on
      seemingly. But that there old Martin geyser is on the job and he might
      close things up. I guess I will wander over."
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great relief he found Mr. Gwynne alone and without preliminaries,
      and with the design of getting "quick action" before the disturbing
      element of Mrs. Gwynne's presence should be introduced, he made his offer.
      He explained his purpose in purchasing, and with something of a flourish
      offered five thousand for "the hull plant, lock, stock and barrel," cash
      down if specially desired, but he would prefer to pay half in six months.
      He must have his answer immediately; was not anxious to buy, but if Mr.
      Gwynne wanted to close up, he only had to say so. He was not going to
      monkey with the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made me a much better offer than the one I received from Mr.
      Martin, and I am inclined to accept it, but inasmuch as I have promised to
      give him an answer to-day, I feel that it's due to him that I should meet
      him with the bargain still unclosed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" enquired Mr. Sleighter in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see I asked him to hold the offer open until this afternoon. I
      feel I ought to go to him with the matter still open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to screw him up, eh?" said Mr. Sleighter, his lips drawing close
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir." Mr. Gwynne's voice had a little ring in it. "I consider it
      fairer to Mr. Martin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't see as how he has much claim on you," replied Mr. Sleighter. "But
      that's your own business. Say, there he comes now. Look here, my offer is
      open until six o'clock. After that it's a new deal. Take it or leave it. I
      will be at your store."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Mr. Gwynne stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter was distinctly annoyed and disappointed. A few minutes'
      longer pressure, he was convinced, would have practically closed a deal
      which would have netted him a considerable profit. "Durn old fool," he
      muttered to himself as he passed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hallway Mrs. Gwynne's kindly welcome halted him. She greeted him as
      she would a friend. Would he not sit down for a few moments. No, he was
      busy. Mr. Sleighter was quite determined to get away from her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The children were delighted with your description of your western home,"
      she said. "The free life, the beautiful hills, the mountains in the
      distance&mdash;it must indeed be a lovely country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter was taken off his guard. "Yes, ma'am, that's lovely country
      all right. They'd like it fine out there, and healthy too. It would make a
      man of that little kid of yours. He looks a little on the weak side to me.
      A few months in the open and you wouldn't know him. The girls too&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in here and sit down, won't you, Mr. Sleighter?" said Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter reluctantly passed into the room and sat down. He knew he
      was taking a risk. However, his offer was already made and the deal he
      believed would be closed in the store by six o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the land is all taken up out there?" said Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, mostly, unless away back. Folks are comin' in all the time, but
      there's still lots of cheap land around."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheap land, is there?" inquired Mrs. Gwynne with a certain eagerness in
      her voice. "Indeed I should have thought that that beautiful land would be
      very dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, bless your heart, no. I know good land going for six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;ten
      dollars an acre. Ten dollars is high for good farm lands; for cattle runs
      four dollars is good. No, there's lots of good land lying around out of
      doors there. If these people around here could get their heads up long
      enough from grubbing in the muck they wouldn't stay here over night.
      They'd be hittin' the trail for the west, you bet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwynne turned her honest eyes upon him. "Mr. Sleighter, I want to ask
      your advice. I feel I can rely upon you ["Durn it all, she's gettin' her
      work in all right," thought Mr. Sleighter to himself], and I am getting
      quite anxious in the matter. You see, my husband is determined to leave
      this place. He wishes to try something else. Indeed, he must try something
      else. We must make a living, Mr. Sleighter." Mrs. Gwynne's voice became
      hurried and anxious. "We were delighted last night by your description of
      that wonderful country in the West, and the children especially. I have
      been wondering if we might venture to try a small farm in that country&mdash;quite
      a small farm. We have a little money to invest. I thought I might be bold
      enough to ask you. I know your judgment would be good and I felt somehow
      that we could trust you. I hope I am not taking a liberty, but somehow I
      feel that you are not a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ma'am, certainly not," said Mr. Sleighter in a loud voice, his hope
      of securing "quick action on that deal" growing dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you happen to know any farm&mdash;a small farm&mdash;which we might be
      able to buy? We hope to receive four thousand dollars for this place. I
      feel that it is worth a good deal more, but there are not many buyers
      about here. Then, of course, perhaps we value our place too highly. Then
      by your kind help we have got something out of the business&mdash;twelve
      hundred and fifty dollars I think Mr. Gwynne said. We are most grateful to
      you for that, Mr. Sleighter." Her eyes beamed on him in a most
      disconcerting way. "And so after our obligations here are met we might
      have about forty-five hundred dollars clear. Could we do anything with
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I donno, I donno," said Mr. Sleighter quickly and rising from his chair,
      "I will think it over. I have got to go now."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr. Gwynne came into the room. "Oh, I am glad you are not
      gone, Mr. Sleighter. I have just told Mr. Martin that I cannot accept his
      offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannot accept, Michael!" said Mrs. Gwynne, dismay in her voice and in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you said your offer was good until six, Mr. Sleighter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I say, Gwynne, let's get out, let's get over to the store. It's kind
      of hot here, and I've got to go. Come on over and we'll clean up." Without
      a farewell word to either of them Mr. Sleighter passed rapidly from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do hope there's nothing wrong, Michael," said his wife. "I fear I have
      made a mistake. I spoke to Mr. Sleighter about the possibility of getting
      a small farm in the West. You were so eager about it, Michael dear, and I
      spoke to Mr. Sleighter about it. I hope there is nothing wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry, mother. I have his offer for five thousand dollars. Of
      course he is rather peculiar, I confess, but I believe&mdash;" The door
      opened abruptly upon them, admitting Mr. Sleighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here, Mr. Gwynne, I can't do no business with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you made me an offer for my farm," said Mr. Gwynne indignantly, "and
      I have just refused an offer from Mr. Martin on account of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we'll cut that all out," said Mr. Sleighter, whose voice and manner
      indicated strong excitement. "Now don't talk. Listen to me, my son. You
      ain't got any right to be playing around with business men anyhow. Now I
      am going to do a little business for you, if you will allow me, ma'am. I
      take it you want to get away from here." Mr. Gwynne nodded, gazing at him
      in astonishment. "You want to go West." Again Mr. Gwynne nodded. "Well,
      there's only one spot in the West&mdash;Alberta. You want a farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mr. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly," said Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's just one farm that will suit you, an' that's Lakeside Farm, Wolf
      Willow, Alberta, owned by H. P. Sleighter, Esq., who's going to stump you
      to a trade. Five hundred acres, one hundred broke an' a timber lot; a
      granary; stables and corral, no good; house, fair to middlin'. Two hundred
      an' fifty acres worth ten dollars at least, best out of doors; cattle run,
      two hundred acres worth five; swamp and sleugh, fifty acres, only good to
      look at but mighty pretty in the mornin' at sun-up. Not much money in
      scenery though. Building worth between two and three thousand. Your plant
      here is worth about six thousand. I know I offered you five thousand, but
      I was buyin' then and now I am buyin' and sellin'. Anyway, I guess it's
      about even, an' we'll save you a lot of trouble an' time an' money. An'
      so, if you really want a western farm, you might just as well have mine. I
      did not think to sell. Of course I knew I must sell in the long run, but
      couldn't just see my place in anybody else's hands. Somehow it seems
      different though to see you folks on it. You seem to fit. Anyway, there's
      the offer. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Mr. Sleighter," said Mr. Gwynne. "This is a rather surprising
      proposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwynne's eyes grew soft. "Michael, I think it is wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Gwynne would not look at his wife. "Let me see, Mr. Sleighter,
      your farm, you say, with buildings, is worth about six thousand to
      sixty-five hundred. Mine is worth from fifty-five hundred to six thousand.
      I will take your offer and pay the difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come off your perch," said Mr. Sleighter. "You're doin' the
      highfalutin' Vere de Vere act now. Listen to me. The deal is as level as I
      can figger it. Your farm and store with the machine business suit me all
      right. I feel I can place my boy right here for a while anyway. My farm, I
      believe, would suit you better than anythin' else you can get. There's my
      offer. Take it or leave it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we will take it, Mr. Sleighter," said Mrs. Gwynne. "Michael dear,
      I feel Mr. Sleighter is right, and besides I know he is doing us a great
      kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kindness, ma'am, not at all. Business is business, and that's all there
      is to it. Well, I'll be goin'. Think it over, get the papers fixed up by
      to-morrow. No, don't thank me. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwynne followed him to the door, her face flushed, her eyes aglow, a
      smile hovering uncertainly about her lips. "Mr. Sleighter," she said, "the
      Lord sent you to us because He knew we were in need of guiding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, ho!" laughed Mr. Sleighter. "Like that Samaritan chap in the reading,
      eh? I guess you had got among thieves all right, more of 'em perhaps than
      you recognised too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sent you to us," repeated Mrs. Gwynne, offering him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I donno but that He steered me to you. But all the same I guess the
      advantage is to me all right." Mr. Sleighter looked hard down the street,
      then turned and faced her squarely. "I want to say that it's done me a
      pile of good to have seen you, ma'am. It's made things look different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a good man, Mr. Sleighter," she said, looking at him with misty
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good man!" Mr. Sleighter was seized with a cough. "A good man! Good
      Lord, ma'am! nobody never found it out but you&mdash;durn that cough
      anyway." And still troubled by his cough, Mr. Sleighter hurried down the
      path to the gate and out on to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once resolved to break up their home in Eastern Canada, the Gwynnes lost
      no time in completing their arrangements for the transportation of
      themselves and their household gods and such of their household goods as
      Mr. Sleighter advised, to the new western country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sleighter appeared to regard the migration of the Gwynne family to the
      western country as an enterprise in which he had made an investment from
      which he was bound to secure the greatest possible return. The principle
      of exchange which had been the basis of the deal as far as the farms were
      concerned was made to apply as far as possible to farm implements and
      equipment, household goods and chattels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use of your packin' a hull bunch of stuff West an' my packin'
      a hull bunch of stuff East. We'll just tote up the stock an' stuff we have
      got and make a deal on it. I know all my stuff an' yours is here. We'll
      make a trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Mr. Gwynne gladly agreed. The arrangement would save trouble and
      useless expenditure. Hence the car was packed with such goods as Mr.
      Sleighter considered especially useful in the new home, and with such
      household furniture as the new home lacked and such articles as were
      precious from family or personal associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the pictures and curtains?" inquired Mr. Gwynne. "We don't
      need them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take 'em all," said Mr. Sleighter. "Pictures are like folks. They got
      faces an' looks. And curtains&mdash;my missis got hers all packed.
      Curtains are like clothes&mdash;they only fit them that owns them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the piano?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing. Say, a piano in that country is like the village pump&mdash;the
      hull country gets about it. Take things to eat an' things to wear an'
      things to make the shack look pretty an' interestin' and comfortable. They
      don't take much room and they take the bareness off. That's what kills the
      women folk in the West, the bareness inside and outside. Nothin' but
      chairs, table an' stove inside; nothin' but grass an' sand outside. That's
      what makes 'em go crazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the car was filled with things to eat and to wear, and things "to take
      the bareness off." Somewhere in the car was found a place for Rosie, the
      cow, a remarkable milker and "worth her weight in butter," as Mr.
      Sleighter said, and for Rover, Larry's collie dog, who stood to him as
      comrade almost as a brother. A place in the car too was found for Joe
      Gagneau who from the first moment of the announced departure had expressed
      his determination to accompany Larry no matter at what cost or against
      whose opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A'm goin' be in dat car' me, by gar!" was his ultimatum, and the various
      authorities interested recognised the inevitable and accepted it, to the
      great delight of both boys. Joe had a mouth organ and so had Larry, and
      they were both in the same key. Joe too had an old fiddle of his father's
      on which he could scrape with joy to himself, and with more or less agony
      to others, the dance tunes of local celebrity, the "Red River Jig," picked
      up from his father, "Money Musk" and "The Deil Amang the Tailors," the two
      latter from Dan Monroe at the country dances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time the car, packed with the Gwynne household goods and treasures
      and in charge of the two superlatively happy boys, with Rosie and Rover to
      aid in providing them with sustenance and protection, set forth, Westward
      Ho! Mr. Gwynne rode in the caboose of the train to which his car was
      attached. Mrs. Gwynne and the girls were to follow by passenger train and
      would doubtless be found awaiting them on their arrival at Winnipeg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey westward was to the boys full of interest and adventure. At
      Toronto they picked up a stowaway, who, taking advantage of their absence,
      boarded the car and made himself a bed behind some bales of hay. Upon
      discovery by Rover, he made so piteous an appeal for refuge from some
      pursuing terror which he declined to specify, that the boys agreed to
      conceal him a night and a day till they were well on their way along the
      north shore of Lake Superior. When Larry's conscience made further
      concealment a burden greater than could be borne, Mr. Gwynne was taken
      into the boys' confidence and, after protest, agreed to make arrangement
      with the railroad authorities whereby Sam&mdash;for that was the
      stowaway's name&mdash;might retain his place in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a poor, wretched creature, reminding Larry of the scarecrow which
      he had put up in their garden the summer before. He was thin beyond
      anything the boys had ever seen. His face was worn and old and came to a
      peak at the nose, which gave him the appearance of a monster rat, a
      resemblance emphasised by the little blinking, red-rimmed eyes. His hair
      was closely cropped and of brilliant carrotty colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had seen life in a great city and had gathered a store of worldly
      wisdom, not all of which was for his good, and a repertoire of
      accomplishments that won him admiration and wonder from the simple country
      boys. He had all the new ragtime songs and dances, which he rendered to
      his own accompaniment on an old battered banjo. He was a contortionist of
      quite unusual cleverness, while his fund of stories never ran dry
      throughout the seven days' journey to Winnipeg. He set himself with the
      greatest assiduity to impart his accomplishments to the boys, and by the
      time the party had reached the end of the first stage in their westward
      journey, Sam had the satisfaction of observing that his pupils had made
      very satisfactory progress, both with the clog dancing and with the
      ragtime songs. Besides this, he had made for himself an assured place in
      their affection, and even Mr. Gwynne had come to feel such an interest in
      the bit of human driftwood flung up against him, that he decided to offer
      the waif a chance to try his fortune in the West.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JANE BROWN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown was a busy man, but he never failed to be in his place at the
      foot of the table every day punctually at half past twelve, solely because
      at that hour his little daughter, Jane, would show her grave and earnest
      and dark brown, almost swarthy, face at the head. Eight years ago another
      face used to appear there, also grave, earnest, but very fair and very
      lovely to look upon, to the doctor the fairest of all faces on the earth.
      The little, plain, swarthy-faced child the next day after that lovely face
      had been forever shut away from the doctor's eyes was placed in her high
      chair at the head of the table, at first only at the lunch hour, but later
      at all meal times before the doctor to look at. And it was an
      ever-recurring joy to the lonely man to discover in the little grave face
      before him fleeting glimpses of the other face so tenderly loved and so
      long vanished. These glimpses were to be discovered now in the deep blue
      eyes, deep in colour and in setting, now in the smile that lit up the
      dark, irregular features like the sudden break of sunlight upon the rough
      landscape, transforming it into loveliness, now in the knitting of the
      heavy eyebrows, and in the firm pressing of the lips in moments of puzzled
      thought. In all the moods and tenses of the little maid the doctor looked
      for and found reminiscences of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through those eight lonely years the little girl had divided with his
      profession the doctor's days. Every morning after breakfast he stood to
      watch the trim, sturdy, round little figure dance down the steps, step
      primly down the walk, turn at the gate to throw a kiss, and then march
      away along the street to the corner where another kiss would greet him
      before the final vanishing. Every day they met at noon to exchange on
      equal terms the experiences of the morning. Every night they closed the
      day with dinner and family prayers, the little girl gravely taking her
      part in the reading during the last year from her mother's Bible. And so
      it came that with the years their friendship grew in depth, in frankness
      and in tenderness. The doctor was widely read beyond the literature of his
      profession, and every day for a half hour it was his custom to share with
      the little girl the treasures of his library. The little maid repaid him
      with a passionate love and a quaint mothering care tender and infinitely
      comforting to the lonely man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forenoon had been hot and trying, and Dr. Brown, having been detained
      in his office beyond his regular hour, had been more than usually hurried
      in his round of morning calls, and hence was more than ordinarily tired
      with his morning's work. At his door the little girl met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Papa, I know you're hot," she said, love and reproach in her
      face, "because I was hot myself, and you will need a nice, cool drink. I
      had one and yours is in here." She led him into the study, hovering about
      him with little touches and pushes. "You ought not to have taken so long a
      round this morning," she said with gentle severity. "I know you went out
      to St. James to see Mrs. Kale, and you know quite well she doesn't need
      you. It would do in the afternoon. And it was awful hot in school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awful?" said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, very exceedingly then&mdash;and the kids were very tired and Miss
      Mutton was as cross as anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was no wonder. How many kids were there for her to watch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Papa, you said 'kids!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just quoting my young daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she said we were to get out this afternoon an hour earlier,"
      continued Jane, ignoring his criticism, "and so I am going to take my
      bicycle and go with Nora and the girls down to the freight sheds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The freight sheds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Larry and Joe have come in, and Rover and Rosie&mdash;she's the cow,
      and they milked her every day twice and drank the milk and they used to
      have their meals together in the car."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rosie, too? Very interesting indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Papa, you must not laugh at me. It is very interesting. They all
      came for days and days together in the car from somewhere down East,
      Ontario, I think. And Mr. Gwynne says they are just like a circus. And
      they play instiments and dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Rosie too? How clever of her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The child's laugh rang out joyously. "Oh, Papa, that's awfully funny. And
      we're going down on our wheels. Nora can ride now, you know, and she's
      going to take Ethel May's wheel. It's awfully hard to ride, but Nora's as
      strong as Kathleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said her father, greatly interested in this exciting but
      somewhat confused tale. "Just wait until I wash my hands and then you
      shall tell me what it all means. Thank you for this deliciously cool
      lemonade. It is very refreshing. You will tell me all about it at lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lunch hour was devoted first of all to disentangling from the mass the
      individual members of the car party, which after an adventurous journey
      across half a continent had apparently made camp at the Winnipeg freight
      sheds. Then followed the elucidation of the details of the plan by which
      this camp was to be attacked and raided during the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that I have a fairly clear conception of whom Larry, Joe, Sam, Rosie
      and Rover are&mdash;I think I have them right&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, Papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to find out just who are to form the advance party, the scouting
      party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The scouting party? I don't know what you mean. But Nora&mdash;you know
      Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, the little black-eyed Irish Terrier&mdash;terror, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Papa, she's just lovely and she's my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she, dear, then I apologise, but indeed I meant nothing derogatory to
      her. I greatly like her, she is so spunky."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there's Nora, and Kathleen, Nora's sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Kathleen, the tall beautiful girl with the wonderful hair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl sighed. "Oh, such lovely long yellow hair." The little
      maid's hair was none of these. "And she is not a bit proud&mdash;just
      nice, you know&mdash;just as if she were not so lovely, but like&mdash;only
      like me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like you, indeed!" exclaimed the doctor indignantly. "Like my little
      girl? I don't see any one quite like my little girl. There is not one of
      them with all their yellow hair and things that is to be compared with my
      own little girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Papa. I know you think so, and I wish it was so. And I am awfully
      glad you think so, but of course you are prejuist, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prejudiced? Not a bit, not a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's Kathleen and Nora, and&mdash;and perhaps Hazel&mdash;you
      know Hazel, Papa, Hazel Sleighter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The western girl&mdash;not at all wild and woolly though. A very modern
      and very advanced young lady, isn't she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know what you mean, Papa. She says she may go down, but I
      don't think she likes going with a lot of kids. You know she has her hair
      up. She has to have it up in the store. She says the man would not have
      her behind the counter if she had not her hair up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's it. I thought perhaps the maturity of her age made it
      necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what maturevy means, but she is awfully old. She is going on
      sixteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, as old as that?" inquired her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but she said she wanted to see that circus car. That's what she
      calls Mr. Gwynne's car. And she says she wants to see the elephunts
      perform. There are not any elephunts. There's only Rosie and Rover. But
      she may get off. She can get off if she can fool her boss, she says. So
      we're all going down and we may bring Larry home with us, Mrs. Sleighter
      says. Though Mrs. Gwynne says there's not any room, they're so filled up
      now. And I said Larry could come here and Joe, too. But I am not so sure
      about Sam. I think he must be awfully queer. Mr. Gwynne thinks he's
      queer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite possible, indeed probable, my dear," assented her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Gwynne said he looked like a third-rate how-do-you-feel
      performer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what, exactly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A how-do-you-feel performer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a vaudeville performer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a fodefeel performer. I don't know what that means, but he must be
      queer. But I think Larry would be all right, and Joe. You see, we know
      THEM."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly, Papa. Larry is Nora's brother. He's awfully clever. He's
      only fifteen and he passed the Entrance in Ontario and that's ever so much
      harder than here. He passed it before he was fourteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before he was fourteen!" replied her father. "Amazing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he plays the mouth organ and the tin whistle and the fiddle, and
      Mr. Gwynne says he has learned some stunts from Sam. I think he must be
      awfully nice. So I said he could come here. And Mrs. Gwynne thanked me so
      nicely, and she's just lovely, Papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen her," said her father, "but I have heard her voice, and I
      quite agree with you. The voice always tells. Have you noticed that? The
      voice gives the keynote of the soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, Papa. There's Mrs. Sleighter's voice. I don't like it very
      much, but I think she's nice inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you are right, my dear. Perhaps I should have said that a certain
      kind of voice always goes with a beautiful soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," replied his daughter. "That's like Mrs. Gwynne's voice. And so
      we'll go down to the car and bring Larry home with us, and perhaps his
      mother will let him come here. She did not say she would and you can't
      tell. She's quiet, you know, but somehow she isn't like Mrs. Sleighter. I
      don't think you could coax her to do what she didn't want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mrs. Sleighter&mdash;can you coax Mrs. Sleighter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, the girls just coax her and coax her, and though she doesn't
      want to a bit, she just gives in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's nice of her. That must be very nice for the girls, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know, Papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? don't you think it is nice to be able to coax people to do what you
      want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nice to get what you want, but I think REALLY, REALLY, you'd rather
      you could not coax them to do it just because you coax them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; you see, you're never really quite sure after you get it whether you
      ought to get it after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said her father; "that rather spoils it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but you never do that, Papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you can't coax me, eh? I am glad to know that. I was afraid, rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of course, I can coax you, Papa, but you usually find some other
      way, and then I know it is quite right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I was quite as sure of that, Jane. But you are going to bring
      Larry home with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if Mrs. Gwynne will let him come. I told her we had four rooms and
      we were only using two, and they are all crowded up in Mrs. Sleighter's,
      two girls in each room, and Tom's room is so tiny, and I don't think Larry
      would like to go in Tom's room. And we have two empty rooms, so we might
      just as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly, we might just as well. You might perhaps mention it to
      Anna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I did, Papa, and she said she would have it all ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is all arranged. I was thinking&mdash;but never mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you were thinking, that I ought to have asked you, Papa; and I
      ought to have. But I knew that when a little boy had no home to go to you
      would of course&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," replied her father hurriedly. "You were quite right, Jane.
      And with those two rooms, why not bring them all, Joe and Pete&mdash;Pete,
      is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam, Papa. I am not so sure. I think we should leave Joe and Sam. You see
      Joe won't mind staying in the car. Nora says he lives in just a shack at
      home, and Sam&mdash;I am a little afraid of Sam. We don't know him very
      well, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. We are quite safe in your hands, little woman. You can do just as
      you and Mrs. Gwynne arrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the father watched the little, trim, sturdy figure stepping down the
      street he muttered to himself, "That child grows more like her mother
      every day." He heaved a great sigh from the depths of his heart. "Well,
      God keep her, wise little woman that she is! I wish I were a wiser man. I
      must be firm with her; it would be a shame to spoil her. Yes, I must be
      firm." But he shrugged his shoulders and smiled at himself. "The worst of
      it is, or the best of it is," he continued, "the little witch is almost
      always right, God bless her, just like her mother, just like her mother."
      He hastily wiped his eyes, and went off to his office where Mrs. Dean
      awaited him and her little girl with the burned hand. And the mother
      wondered at the gentleness of him as he dressed the little girl's wounded
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It followed that the scouting party included not only Miss Hazel
      Sleighter, but also her big brother Tom, who, being temporarily in the
      high school, more perhaps because of his size and the maturity of his
      bearing than by virtue of his educational qualifications, was at the
      present moment most chiefly concerned in getting into form his baseball
      team for the match the following Saturday in which the High School was to
      meet All Comers under eighteen. The freight shed being on his way to the
      practice ground, Tom deigned to join the party and to take in the circus
      car as he passed. The car dwellers were discovered on the open prairie not
      far from the freight shed, keeping guard over Rosie, who was stretching
      her legs after her railway journey. The boys were tossing a baseball to
      each other as Tom pedalled up on his wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, there, here you are," he shouted to Sam, holding up his hands for
      a catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball came with such impact that Tom was distinctly jarred, and dropped
      the ball. With all his force he threw the ball back to Sam, who caught it
      with the ease of a professional and returned it with such vigour that
      again Tom dropped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have a knock-up," he said, hitting a long fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam flew after the ball with amazing swiftness, his scarecrow garments
      fluttering and flapping in the air, and caught it with an upward leap that
      landed him on his back breathless but triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you're a crackerjack," said Tom; "here's another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Larry was in the hands of his sisters, who had delightedly
      kissed him to his shamefaced chagrin, and introduced him to their
      new-found friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So this is Larry." said Miss Hazel Sleighter, greeting him with a
      dazzling smile. "We have heard a lot about you. I think you must be quite
      wonderful. Come here, Tom, and meet your friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Larry! In the presence of this radiant creature and of her
      well-dressed brother, he felt terribly conscious of the shabbiness of the
      second best suit which his mother had thought good enough for the journey
      in the car. Tom glanced at the slight, poorly dressed, pale-faced lad who
      stood before him with an embarrassed, almost a beseeching look in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you play ball?" asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much," replied Larry; "not like Sam. Come here, Sam," he called,
      remembering that he had not introduced his friend. Sam shuffled over with
      an air of complete nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Sam," said Larry. "Sam&mdash;I have forgotten your name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nolan," said Sam shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Hazel Sleighter," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Miss Hazel," said Sam, sweeping her an elaborate bow, and
      then gazing boldly into her eyes. "I hope you're well. If you're as smart
      as you look, I guess you're way up in G."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite well, thank you," returned Miss Hazel, the angle of her chin
      indicating her most haughty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, young lady, pass up the chilly stuff," replied Sam with a laugh. "It
      don't go with that mighty fine complexion of yours. Say, did you ever see
      the leading lady in 'The Spider's Web'? Well, you make me think of her,
      and she was a peacherino. Never seen her? No? Well, you ought to see her
      some day and think of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel turned a disgusted shoulder on Sam's impudent face and engaged Larry
      in vivacious conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am off to the ball practice," said Tom. "Got a match on Saturday&mdash;High
      School against the world. Guess they would like to have you, Sam, only I
      wouldn't care to have you play against us. You don't play baseball, eh?"
      continued Tom, addressing Larry. "What do you play&mdash;football?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much; never tried much," said Larry, flushing over his lack of
      sporting qualifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He plays the fiddle," said a quiet little voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry, flushing violently, turned around and saw a little, brown-faced
      maid gazing thoughtfully at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he does, eh? Ha, ha, ha. Good game, eh? Ha, ha, ha." They all joined
      in the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he plays the mouth organ, too, and does funny stunts," sturdily
      continued the little girl, disdaining Tom's scornful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he passed his entrance to the High School a year ago when he was
      fourteen, in Ontario, anyway." This appeared to check Tom's hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My, what a wonder he is! And did he tell you all this himself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," said Jane indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am glad to hear that," said Tom with a grin. "Won't you come along,
      Sam? It's only a little way down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Sam cheerfully. "So long, folks. See you later, Larry.
      Au reservoir, young lady, as the camel said to the elephant when he asked
      what he'd have. Hope I see you later if not sooner&mdash;ta-ta;
      tinga-ling; honk honk." Again he swept Miss Hazel an elaborate bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thinks he's smart," said that young lady, lifting her nose. "He's a
      regular scarecrow. Who in the world is he and where did he come from?" she
      demanded of Larry, who proceeded to account for Sam's presence with their
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors peered into the car and poked into its recesses, discovered
      the food supplies for boy and beast, and inspected the dormitories under
      Larry's guidance, while the boy, who had recovered from his embarrassment,
      discoursed upon the wonderful experience of the journey. Miss Hazel
      flashed her great blue eyes and her white teeth upon him, shook all her
      frizzes in his face, smiled at him, chattered to him, jeered at him,
      flattered him with all the arts and graces of the practiced flirt she was,
      until Larry, swept from his bearings, walked the clouds in a wonder world
      of rosy lights and ravishing airs. His face, his eyes, his eager words,
      his tremulous lips, were all eloquent of this new passion that possessed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Miss Hazel, accustomed as she was to the discriminating admiration
      of her fellow clerks, the sincerity and abandonment of this devotion was
      as incense to her flirtatious soul. Avid of admiration and experienced in
      most of the arts and wiles necessary to secure this from contiguous males,
      small wonder that the unsophisticated Larry became her easy prey long
      before she had brought to bear the full complement of her enginery of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy afternoon for the boy, but when informed by his sisters of
      his mother's desire that he should return with them, he was resolute in
      his refusal, urging many reasons why it was impossible that he should
      leave the car and his comrades. There was nothing for it but to leave him
      there and report to his mother their failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might have known," she said. "He would never come to a stranger's house
      in his old clothes. I will just bring down his best suit after tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner hour at Dr. Brown's was fully occupied with an animated recital
      of the adventures of the afternoon. Each member of the car party was
      described with an accuracy and fulness of detail that would have surprised
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you know, Papa," said the little maid, "Tom just laughed at Larry
      because he could not play baseball and things, and I just told him that
      Larry could play the mouth organ lovely and the fiddle, and they laughed
      and laughed. I think they were laughing at me. Tom laughed loudest of all,
      and he's not so smart himself, and anyway Larry passed the entrance a year
      ago and I just told him so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, did you," said her father, "and how did Master Tom take that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't laugh quite as much. I don't think I like him very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Hazel, she was just lovely to Larry. I think she's nice, Papa, and
      such lovely cheeks and hair." Here Jane sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, has she? She is quite a grown-up young lady, is she not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has her hair up, Papa. She's sixteen, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember you told me that she had reached that mature age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I think Larry liked her, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah? And why do you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He just looked at her, and looked, and looked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that seems fairly good evidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he is coming up here to-night when we bring him his good clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are to bring him his good clothes, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mrs. Gwynne and I are taking them down in the carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, in the carriage&mdash;Mrs. Gwynne&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you know&mdash;Oh, here's Nora at the door. Excuse me, Papa. I am
      sure it is important."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the door and in a moment or two returned with a note. "It's for
      you, Papa, and I know it's about the carriage." She watched her father
      somewhat anxiously as he read the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Umm-um. Very good, very nice and proper. Certainly. Just say to Mrs.
      Gwynne that we are very pleased to be able to serve her with the carriage,
      and that we hope Larry will do us the honour of coming to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane nodded delightedly. "I know, Papa. I told her that already. But I'll
      tell her this is the answer to the note."
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Jane's direction and care they made their visit to the car, but on
      their return no Larry was with them. He would come after the picnic and
      baseball game tomorrow, perhaps, but not to-night. His mother was plainly
      disappointed, and indeed a little hurt. She could not understand her son.
      It was not his clothes after all as she had thought. She pondered over his
      last words spoken as he bade her farewell at the car door, and was even
      more mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be glad when we get to our own place again," he said. "I hate to be
      beholden to anybody. We're as good as any of them anyway." The bitterness
      in his tone mystified her still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was little Jane who supplied the key to the mystery. "I don't think he
      likes Tom very much," said the little girl. "He likes Hazel, though. But
      he might have come to our house; I did not laugh." And then the mother
      thought she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sudden intensity of bitterness in her boy's voice startled her a
      little, but deep down in her heart she was conscious of a queer feeling of
      satisfaction, almost of pride. "He's just like his father," she said to
      herself. "He likes to be independent." Strict honesty in thought made her
      add, "And like me, too, I fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      The picnic day was one of those intensely hot June days when the whole
      world seems to stand quivering and breathlessly attent while Nature works
      out one of her miracles over fields of grain, over prairie flowers, over
      umbrageous trees and all things borne upon the bosom of Mother Earth,
      checking the succulence of precocious overgrowths, hardening fibre,
      turning plant energy away from selfish exuberance in mere stalk building
      into the altruistic sacrament of ripening fruit and hardening grain. A
      wise old alchemist is Mother Earth, working in time but ever for eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picnickers who went out to the park early in the day were driven for
      refuge from the blazing sun to the trees and bushes, where prostrated by
      the heat they lay limp and flaccid upon the grass. Miss Hazel Sleighter,
      who for some reason which she could not explain to herself had joined the
      first contingent of picnickers, was cross, distinctly and obviously cross.
      The heat was trying to her nerves, but worse, it made her face red&mdash;red
      all over. Her pink parasol intensified the glow upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fool I was to come, in this awful heat," she said to herself.
      "They won't be here for hours, and I will be just like a wash-rag."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Larry enjoying the picnic. The material comforts in the form of
      sandwiches, cakes and pies, gloriously culminating in lemonade and ice
      cream, while contributing a temporary pleasure, could not obliterate a
      sense of misery wrought in him by Miss Hazel's chilly indifference. That
      young lady, whose smiles so lavishly bestowed only yesterday had made for
      him a new heaven and a new earth, had to-day merely thrown him a passing
      glance and a careless "Hello," as she floated by intent on bigger game.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the boy was conscious of an overpowering lassitude that
      increased as the day wore on. His misery and its chief cause had not
      escaped the observing eyes of the little maid, Jane Brown, whose clear and
      incisive voice was distinctly audible as she confided to her friend Nora
      her disappointment in Miss Hazel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't look at him to-day," she said. "She's just waiting for the boys
      to come. She'll be nicer then."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no animus in the voice, only surprise and disappointment. To
      Larry, however, the fact that the secret tragedy of his soul was thus laid
      bare, filled him with a sudden rage. He cast a wrathful eye upon the
      little maid. She met his glance with a placid smile, volunteering the
      cheerful remark, "They won't be long now."
    </p>
    <p>
      A fury possessed the boy. "Oh shut your mouth, will you?" he said, glaring
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment little Jane looked at him, surprise, dismay, finally pity
      succeeding each other in the deep blue eyes. Hastily she glanced about to
      see if the others had heard the awful outburst. She was relieved to note
      that only Joe and Nora were near enough to hear. She settled herself down
      in a position of greater comfort and confided to her friend Nora with an
      air of almost maternal solicitude, "I believe he has a pain. I am sure he
      has a pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry sprang to his feet, and without a glance at his anxious tormentor
      said, "Come on, Joe, let's go for a hunt in the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked wistfully after the departing boys. "I wish they would ask us,
      Nora. Don't you? I think he is nice when he isn't mad," she said. To which
      Nora firmly assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breeze from the west and the arrival of the High School team,
      resplendent in their new baseball uniforms, brought to the limp loiterers
      under the trees a reviving life and interest in the day's doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due to Jane that Sam got into the game, for when young Frank Smart
      was searching for a suitable left fielder to complete the All Comers team,
      he spied seated among the boys the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Jane; in your usual place, I see!" he called out to her as he
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Frank!" she called to him brightly. "Frank! Frank!" she cried,
      after the young man had passed, springing up and running after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am in a hurry, Jane; I must get a man for left field."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Frank," she said, catching his arm, for young Smart was a great
      friend of hers and of her father's. "I want to tell you. You see that
      funny boy under the tree," she continued, lowering her voice. "Well, he's
      a splendid player. Tom doesn't want him to play, and I don't either,
      because I want the High School to beat. But it would not be fair not to
      tell you, would it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Smart looked at her curiously. "Say, little girl, you're a sport.
      And is he a good player?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's splendid, but he's queer&mdash;I mean he looks queer. He's
      awfully funny. But that doesn't matter, does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a hair, if he can play ball. What's his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam&mdash;something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam Something? That is a funny name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you know, Sam. I don't know his other name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll try him, Jane," said young Smart, moving toward the boy and
      followed by the eager eyes of the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Sam," said Smart, "we want a man for left field. Will you take a
      go at it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too hot," grunted Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you won't find it too hot when you get started. Rip off your coat and
      get into the game. You can play, can't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, what yer givin' us. I guess I can give them ginks a few pointers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too hot," said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane pulled young Smart by the sleeve. "Tell him you will give him a
      jersey," she said in a low voice. "His shirt is torn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again young Smart looked at Jane with scrutinising eyes. "You're a
      wonder," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, Sam. You haven't got your sweater with you, but I will get
      one for you. Get into the bush there and change."
    </p>
    <p>
      With apparent reluctance, but with a gleam in his little red eyes, Sam
      slouched into the woods to make the change, and in a few moments came
      forth and ran to take his position at left field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baseball match turned out to be a mere setting for the display of the
      eccentricities and superior baseball qualities of Sam, which apparently
      quite outclassed those of his teammates in the match. After three
      disastrous innings, Sam caused himself to be moved first to the position
      of short stop, and later to the pitcher's box, to the immense advantage of
      his side. But although, owing to the lead obtained by the enemy, his
      prowess was unable to ward off defeat from All Comers, yet under his
      inspiration and skilful generalship, the team made such a brilliant
      recovery of form and came so near victory that Sam was carried from the
      field in triumph shoulder high and departed with his new and
      enthusiastically grateful comrades to a celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry, however, was much too miserable and much too unhappy for anything
      like a celebration. The boy was oppressed with a feeling of loneliness,
      and was conscious chiefly of a desire to reach his car and crawl into his
      bed there among the straw. Stumbling blindly along the dusty road; a
      cheery voice hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Larry!" It was Jane seated beside her father in his car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" he answered faintly and just glanced at her as the car passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon the car pulled up. "Come on, Larry, we'll take you home," said
      Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm all right," said Larry, forcing his lips into his old smile and
      resolutely plodding on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better come up, my boy," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind walking, sir," replied Larry, stubbornly determined to go
      his lonely way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, boy," said the doctor, regarding him keenly. Larry came over
      to the wheel. "Why, boy, what is the matter?" The doctor took hold of his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry gripped the wheel hard. He was feeling desperately ill and unsteady
      on his legs, but still his lips twisted themselves into a smile. "I'm all
      right, sir," he said; "I've got a headache and it was pretty hot out
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he spoke his face grew white and he swayed on his feet. In an
      instant the doctor was out of his car. "Get in, lad," he said briefly, and
      Larry, surrendering, climbed into the back seat, fighting fiercely
      meanwhile to prevent the tears from showing in his eyes. Keeping up a
      brisk and cheerful conversation with Jane in regard to the game, the
      doctor drove rapidly toward his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will come in with us, my boy," said the doctor as they reached his
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Larry was past all power of resistance and yielded himself to
      the authority of the doctor, who had him upstairs and into bed within a
      few minutes of his arrival. A single word Larry uttered during this
      process, "Tell my mother," and then sank into a long nightmare, through
      which there mingled dim shapes and quiet voices, followed by dreamless
      sleep, and an awakening to weakness that made the lifting of his eyelids
      an effort and the movement of his hand a weariness. The first object that
      loomed intelligible through the fog in which he seemed to move was a
      little plain face with great blue eyes carrying in them a cloud of
      maternal anxiety. Suddenly the cloud broke and the sun burst through in a
      joyous riot, for in a voice that seemed to him unfamiliar and remote Larry
      uttered the single word, "Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried the little girl rapturously. "Oh, Larry, wait." She slipped
      from the room and returned in a moment with his mother, who quickly came
      to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are rested, dear," she said, putting her hand under his head. "Drink
      this. No, don't lift your head. Now then, go to sleep again, darling,"
      and, stooping down, she kissed him softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;are&mdash;you&mdash;crying?" he asked faintly. "What's the&mdash;matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, darling; you are better. Just sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better?&mdash;Have&mdash;I&mdash;been&mdash;sick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you have been sick," said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully sick," said Jane solemnly. "A whole week sick. But you are all
      right now," she added brightly, "and so is Joe, and Sam, and Rover and
      Rosie. I saw them all this morning and you know we have been praying and
      praying and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now he will sleep, Jane," said his mother, gently touching the little
      girl's brown tangle of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he will sleep; oh, I'm just awful thankful," said Jane, suddenly
      rushing out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear little girl," said the mother. "She has been so anxious and so
      helpful&mdash;a wonderful little nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Larry was fast asleep, and before he was interested enough to make
      inquiry about his comrades in travel the car in charge of Joe and Sam,
      with Mr. Gwynne in the caboose, was far on its way to Alberta. After some
      days Jane was allowed to entertain the sick boy, as was her custom with
      her father, by giving an account of her day's doings. These were happy
      days for them both. Between the boy and the girl the beginnings of a great
      friendship sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry, I think you are queer," said Jane to him gravely one day. "You are
      not a bit like you were in the car."
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick flush appeared on the boy's face. "I guess I was queer that day,
      Jane," he said. "I know I felt queer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it," said Jane, delighted by some sudden recollection. "You
      were queer then, and now you're just ornary. My, you were sick and you
      were cross, too, awful cross that day. I guess it was the headick. I get
      awfully cross, too, when I have the headick. I don't think you will be
      cross again ever, will you, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry, smiling at her, replied, "I'll never be cross with you, Jane,
      anyway, never again."

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GIRL OF THE WOOD LOT
    </h3>
    <p>
      June, and the sun flooding with a golden shimmer a land of tawny prairie,
      billowy hills, wooded valleys and mountain peaks white with eternal snows,
      touching with silver a stream which, glacier-born, hurled itself down
      mountain sides in fairy films of mist, rushed through canyons in a mad
      torrent, hurried between hills in a swollen flood, meandered along wide
      valleys in a full-lipped tide, lingered in a placid lake in a bit of
      lowland banked with poplar bluffs, and so onward past ranch-stead and
      homestead to the great Saskatchewan and Father Ocean, prairie and hills,
      valleys and mountains, river and lake, making a wonder world of light and
      warmth and colour and joyous life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two riders on rangey bronchos, followed by two Russian boarhounds, climbed
      the trail that went winding up among the hills towards a height which
      broke abruptly into a ridge of bare rock. Upon the ridge they paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! Can you beat that? If so, where?" The lady swept her gauntletted
      hand toward the scene below. Mrs. Waring-Gaunt was tall, strongly made,
      handsome with that comeliness which perfect health and out-of-doors life
      combine to give, her dark hair, dark flashing eyes, straight nose, wide,
      full-lipped curving mouth, and a chin whose chiselled firmness was
      softened but not weakened by a dimple, making a picture good to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" she cried again, "tell me, can you beat it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glorious! Sybil, utterly and splendidly glorious!" said her brother, his
      eyes sweeping the picture below. "And you too, Sybil," he said, turning
      his eyes upon her. "This country has done you well. By jove, what a
      transformation from the white-faced, willowy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weedy," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as it's no longer true, weedy&mdash;woman that faded out of London,
      how many&mdash;eight years ago!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten years, ten long, glorious, splendid years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten years! Surely not ten!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ten beautiful years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to God I had come with you then. I might have been&mdash;well, I
      should have been saved some bumps and a ghastly cropper at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cut it out,' Jack, as the boys say here. En avant! We never look back in
      this land, but ever forward. Oh, now isn't this worth while?" Again she
      swept her hand toward the scene below her. "Look at that waving line in
      the east, that broad sweep; and here at our left, those great, majestic
      things. I love them. I love every scar in their old grey faces. They have
      been good friends to me. But for them some days might have been hard to
      live through, but they were always there like friends, watching,
      understanding. They kept me steady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have had some difficult days, old girl, in this awful land. Yes,
      yes, I know it's glorious, especially on a day like this and in a light
      like this; but after all, you are away from the world, away from
      everybody, and shut off from everything, from life, art&mdash;how could
      you stick it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack are you sympathising with me? Let me tell you your sympathy is
      wasted. I have had lonely days in this land, of course. When Tom was off
      on business&mdash;Oh! that man has been perfectly splendid. Jack! He's
      been&mdash;well, I can't tell you all he has been to me&mdash;father,
      mother, husband, chum, he's been to me, and more. And he's made good in
      the country, too. Now look again at this view. We always stop to look at
      it, Tom and I, from this point. Tell me if you have ever seen anything
      quite as wonderful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's glorious, a little like the veldt, with, of course, the
      mountains extra, and they do rather finish the thing in the grand style."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grand style, well, rather! A great traveller who has seen most of the
      world's beautiful spots told me he had never looked on anything quite so
      splendid as the view from here&mdash;so spacious, so varied, so majestic.
      Ah, I love it, and the country has been good to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean physically only, but in every way&mdash;in body, soul and
      mind. And for Tom, too, the country has done much. In England, you know,
      he was just loafing, filling in time with one useless thing after another,
      and on the way to get fat and lazy. Here he is doing things, things worth
      while. His ranch is quite a success. Then he is always busy organising
      various sorts of industries in the country&mdash;dairying, lumbering and
      that sort of thing. He has introduced thoroughbred stock. He helps with
      the schools, the churches, the Agricultural Institutes. In short, he is
      doing his part to bring this country to its best. And this, you know, is
      the finest bit of all Canada!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother laughed. "Pardon me," he said, "there are so many of these
      'finest bits.' In Nova Scotia, in Quebec, I have found them. The people of
      Ontario are certain that the 'finest bit' is in their province, while in
      British Columbia they are ready to fight if one suggests anything to the
      contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I know. It is perfectly splendid of them. You know we Canadians
      are quite foolish about our country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "WE Canadians!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. WE Canadians. What else? We are quite mad about the future of our
      country. And that is why I wanted you to come out here, Jack. There is so
      much a man like you might do with your brains and training. Yes. Your
      Oxford training is none too good for this country, and your brain none too
      clever for this big work of laying the foundations of a great Empire. This
      is big enough for the biggest of you. Bigger, even, than the thing you
      were doing at home, Jack. Oh, I heard all about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard all about it? I hope not. I hope you have not heard of the
      awful mess I made of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Jack! 'Forward' is the word here. Here is an Empire in the
      making, another Britain, greater, finer, and without the hideous
      inequalities, injustices and foolish class distinctions of the old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! Sybil, you sound like Lloyd George himself! Please don't recall
      that ghastly radicalism to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind what it sounds like. You will get it too. We all catch it
      here, especially Old Country folk. For instance, look away to the left
      there. See that little clump of buildings beside the lake just through the
      poplars. There is a family of Canadians typical of the best, the Gwynnes,
      our closest neighbours. Good Irish stock, they are. They came two years
      after we came. Lost their little bit of money. Suffered, my! how they must
      have suffered! though they were too proud to tell any of us. The father is
      a gentleman, finely educated, but with no business ability. The mother all
      gold and grit, heroic little woman who kept the family together. The
      eldest boy of fifteen or sixteen, rather delicate when he came, but
      fearfully plucky, has helped amazingly. He taught the school, putting his
      money into the farm year after year. While teaching the school he somehow
      managed to grip hold of the social life of this community in a wonderful
      way, preached for Mr. Rhye, taught a Bible Class for him, quite unique in
      its way; organised a kind of Literary-Social-Choral-Minstrel Club and has
      added tremendously to the life and gaiety of the neighbourhood. What we
      shall do when he leaves, I know not. You will like them, I am sure. We
      shall drop in there on our way, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well, perhaps sometime later. They all sound rather terribly
      industrious and efficient for a mere slacker like myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the trail they galloped, following the dogs for a mile or so until
      checked by a full flowing stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Willow Creek is really quite in flood," said his sister. "The hot
      sun has brought down the snows, you know. The logs are running, too. We
      will have to go a bit carefully. Hold well up to the stream and watch the
      logs. Keep your eye on the bank opposite. No, no, keep up, follow me. Look
      out, or you will get into deep water. Keep to the right. There, that's
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say," said her brother, as his horse clambered out of the swollen
      stream. "That's rather a close thing to a ducking. Awfully like the veldt
      streams, you know. Ice cold, too, I fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ice cold, indeed, glacier water, you know, and these logs make it very
      awkward. The Gwynnes must be running down their timber and firewood. We
      might just run up and look in on them. It's only a mile or so. Nora will
      be there. She will be 'bossing the job,' as she says. It will be rather
      interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope it is not too far, for I assure you I am getting quite
      ravenous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, come along, there's a good trail here."
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart canter brought them to a rather pretentious homestead with
      considerable barns and outbuildings attached. "This is the Switzers'
      place," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "German-Americans, old settlers and quite
      well off. The father owned the land on which Wolf Willow village stands.
      He made quite a lot of money in real estate&mdash;village lots and farm
      lands, you know. He is an excellent farmer and ambitious for his family&mdash;one
      son and one daughter. They are quite plain people. They live like&mdash;well,
      like Germans, you know. The mother is a regular hausfrau; the daughter,
      quite nice, plays the violin beautifully. It was from her young Gwynne got
      his violining. The son went to college in the States, then to Germany for
      a couple of years. He came back here a year ago, terribly German and
      terribly military, heel clicking, ram-rod back, and all that sort of
      thing. Musical, too, awfully clever; rather think he has political
      ambitions. We'll not go in to-day. Some day, perhaps. Indeed, we must be
      neighbourly in this country. But the Switzers are a little trying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why know them at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are!" cried his sister. "Fancy living beside people in this
      country and not knowing them. Can't you see that we must not let things
      get awry that way? We must all pull together. Tom is fearfully strong on
      that, and he is right, too, I suppose, although it is trying at times. Now
      we begin to climb a bit here. Then there are good stretches further along
      where we can hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed to her brother that the good stretches were rather fewer and
      shorter than the others, for the sun was overhead when they pulled up
      their horses, steaming and ready enough to halt, in a small clearing in
      the midst of a thick bit of forest. The timber was for the main part of
      soft woods, poplar, yellow and black, cottonwood, and further up among
      hills spruce and red pine. In the centre of the clearing stood a rough log
      cabin with a wide porch running around two sides. Upon this porch a young
      girl was to be seen busy over a cook stove. At the noise of the
      approaching horses the girl turned from her work and looked across the
      clearing at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens above! who is that, Sybil?" gasped her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waring-Gaunt gave a delighted little cry. "Oh, my dear, you are
      really back." In a moment she was off her horse and rushing toward the
      girl with her arms outstretched. "Kathleen, darling! Is it you? And you
      have really grown, I believe! Or is it your hair? Come let me introduce
      you to my brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Romayne was a young man with thirty years of experience of the normal
      life of the well-born Englishman, during which time he had often known
      what it was to have his senses stirred and his pulses quickened by the
      sight of one of England's fair women, than whom none of fresher and fairer
      beauty are to be found in all the world; yet never had he found himself
      anything but master of his speech and behaviour. But to-day, when, in
      obedience to his sister's call, he moved across the little clearing toward
      the girl standing at her side, he seemed to lose consciousness of himself
      and control of his powers of action. He was instead faintly conscious that
      a girl of tall and slender grace, with an aura of golden hair about a face
      lovelier than he had ever known, was looking at him out of eyes as blue as
      the prairie crocus and as shy and sweet, that she laid her hand in his as
      if giving him something of herself, that holding her hand how long he knew
      not, he found himself gazing through those eyes of translucent blue into a
      soul of unstained purity as one might gaze into a shrine, and that he
      continued gazing until the blue eyes clouded and the fair face flushed
      crimson, that then, without a word, he turned from her, thrilling with a
      new gladness which seemed to fill not only his soul but the whole world as
      well. When he came to himself he found his trembling fingers fumbling with
      the bridle of his horse. For a few moments he became aware of a blind rage
      possessing him and he cursed deeply his stupidity and the gaucherie of his
      manner. But soon he forgot his rage for thinking of her eyes and of what
      he had seen behind their translucent blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child," again exclaimed Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "I declare you have
      actually grown taller and grown&mdash;a great many other things that I may
      not tell you. What have they done to you at that wonderful school? Did you
      love it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl flushed with a quick emotion. "Oh, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, it was
      really wonderful. I had such a good time and every one was lovely to me. I
      did not know people could be so kind. But it is good to get back home
      again to them all, and to you, and to all this." She waved her hand to the
      forest about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who are up here to-day, and what are you doing?" inquired Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the meantime I am preparing dinner," said the girl with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner!" exclaimed Jack Romayne, who had meantime drawn near, determined
      to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of this girl as a man familiar with
      the decencies of polite society. "Dinner! It smells so good and we are
      desperately hungry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "My brother declared he was quite faint
      more than an hour ago, and now I am sure he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairly ravenous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't know," said the girl with serious anxiety on her face. "You
      see, we have only pork and fried potatoes, and Nora just shot a chicken&mdash;only
      one&mdash;and they are always so hungry. But we have plenty of bread and
      tea. Would you stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds really very nice," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be awfully jolly of you, and I promise not to eat too much,"
      said the young man. "I am actually faint with hunger, and a cup of tea
      appears necessary to revive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, stay," said the girl with quick sympathy. "We can't give you
      much, but we can give you something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;&mdash;ho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O-h-o-o-o-h! O-h-o-o-o-h!" A loud call came from the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Nora," said Kathleen. "O-o-o-o-o-h! O-o-o-o-o-h!" The girl's
      answering call was like the winding of a silver horn. "Here she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out from the woods, striding into the clearing, came a young girl dressed
      in workmanlike garb in short skirt, leggings and jersey, with a soft black
      hat on the black tumbled locks. "Hello, Kathleen, dinner ready? I'm
      famished. Oh, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, glad to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my brother, Nora, Mr. Jack Romayne, just come from England, and
      hungry as a bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just from England? And hungry? Well, we are glad to see you, Mr.
      Romayne." The girl came forward with a quick step and frankly offered her
      brown, strong hand. "We're awfully glad to see you, Mr. Romayne," she
      repeated. "I ought to be embarrassed, I know, only I am so hungry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just my fix, Miss Nora," said the young man. "I am really anxious to be
      polite. I feel we should decline the invitation to dinner which your
      sister has pressed upon us; we know it is a shame to drop in on you like
      this all unprepared, but I am so hungry, and really that smell is so
      irresistible that I feel I simply cannot be polite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!" cried the girl, "or rather, do, and stay. There's enough of
      something, and Joe will look after the horses." She put her hands to her
      lips and called, "J-o-o-e!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice from the woods answered her, followed by Joe himself. "Here, Joe,
      take the horses and unsaddle them and tether them out somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Kathleen's fears there was dinner enough for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is perfectly stunning!" said Romayne, glancing round the little
      clearing and up at the trees waving overhead, through the interstices of
      whose leafy canopy showed patches of blue sky. "Gorgeous, by Jove! Words
      are futile things for really great moments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ripping," said Nora, smiling impudently into his face. "Awfully jolly!
      A-1! Top hole! That's the lot, I think, according to the best authorities.
      Do you know any others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon, what?" said Romayne, looking up from his fried pork and
      potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are all I have learned in English at least," said Nora. "I am keen
      for some more. They are Oxford, I believe. Have you any others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romayne diverted his attention from his dinner. "What is she talking
      about, Miss Gwynne? I confess to be entirely absorbed in these fried
      potatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Words, words, Mr. Romayne, vocabulary, adjectives," replied Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Romayne, "but why should one worry about words, especially
      adjectives, when one has such divine realities as these to deal with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have some muffles, Mr. Romayne," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Muffles? Now what may muffles be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Muffles are a cross between muffins and waffles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please elucidate their nature and origin," said Mr. Romayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me show you," said Kathleen. She sprang up, dived into the cabin and
      returned with a large, round, hard biscuit in her hand. "This is Hudson
      Bay hard tack, the stand-by of all western people&mdash;Hudson Bay
      freighters and cowboys, old timers and tenderfeet alike swear by it. See,
      you moisten it slightly in water, fry it in boiling fat, sugar it and keep
      hot till served. Thus Hudson Bay hard tack becomes muffles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marvellous!" exclaimed Mr. Romayne, "and truly delicious! And to think
      that the Savoy chef knows nothing about muffles! But now that my first
      faintness is removed and the mystery of muffles is solved, may I inquire
      just what you are doing up here to-day, Miss Gwynne? What is the business
      on hand, I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora is getting out some logs for building and firewood for next
      winter. The logs, you see, are cut during the winter and hauled to the
      dump there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dump!" exclaimed Mr. Romayne faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. The bank there where you dump the logs into the creek below."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what exactly has Miss Nora to do with all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" enquired Nora, "I only boss the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you believe her," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "I happen to remember one
      winter day coming upon this young lady in these very woods driving her
      team and hauling logs to the dump while Sam and Joe did the cutting. Ask
      the boys there? And why shouldn't she?" continued Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "She
      can run a farm, with garden, pigs and poultry thrown in; open a coal mine
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" exclaimed Nora, "the boys here do it all. Mother furnishes the
      head work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora!" protested Kathleen, "you know you manage everything. Isn't
      that true, boys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's the hull works herself," said Sam. "Ain't she, Joe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet yeh," said Joe, husky with the muffles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a corker," continued Sam, "double compressed, compensating, forty
      horsepower, ain't she, Joe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet yeh!" adding, for purpose of emphasis, "By gar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six cylinder, self-starter," continued Sam with increasing enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Self-starter," echoed Joe, going off into a series of choking chuckles.
      "Sure t'ing, by gar!" Joe, having safely disposed of the muffles, gave
      himself up to unrestrained laughter, throwing back his head, slapping his
      knees and repeating at intervals, "Self-starter, by gar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So infectious was his laughter that the whole company joined in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut it out, boys," said Nora. "You are all talking rot, you know; and
      what about you," she added, turning swiftly upon her sister. "Who runs the
      house, I'd like to know, and looks after everything inside, and does the
      sewing? This outfit of mine, for instance? And her own outfit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora," protested Kathleen, the colour rising in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you make your own costume?" inquired Mr. Romayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did that," said Nora, "and mine and mother's, and she makes father's
      working shirts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora, stop, please. You know I do very little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She makes the butter as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're a pair," said Sam in a low growl, but perfectly audible to the
      company, "a regular pair, eh, Joe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure t'ing," replied Joe, threatening to go off again into laughter, but
      held in check by a glance from Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour they lingered over the meal. Then Nora, jumping up quickly,
      took Mrs. Waring-Gaunt with her to superintend the work at the dump,
      leaving Mr. Romayne reclining on the grass smoking his pipe in abandoned
      content, while Kathleen busied herself clearing away and washing up the
      dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I help?" inquired Mr. Romayne, when the others had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," replied Kathleen. "Just rest where you are, please; just take it
      easy; I'd really rather you would, and there's nothing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not an expert at this sort of thing," said Mr. Romayne, "but at
      least I can dry dishes. I learned that much on the veldt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In South Africa? You were in the war?" replied Kathleen, giving him a
      towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I had a go at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must have been terrible&mdash;to think of actually killing men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not pleasant," replied Romayne, shrugging his shoulders, "but it
      has to be done sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do you think so? It does not seem as if it should be necessary at any
      time," said the girl with great earnestness. "I can't believe it is either
      right or necessary ever to kill men; and as for the Boer War, don't you
      think everybody agrees now that it was unnecessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romayne was always prepared to defend with the ardour of a British
      soldier the righteousness of every war in which the British Army has ever
      been engaged. But somehow he found it difficult to conduct an argument in
      favour of war against this girl who stood fronting him with a look of
      horror in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Romayne, "I believe there is something to be said on both
      sides. No doubt there were blunders in the early part of the trouble, but
      eventually war had to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's just it," cried the girl. "Isn't that the way it is always? In
      the early stages of a quarrel it is so easy to come to an understanding
      and to make peace; but after the quarrel has gone on, then war becomes
      inevitable. If only every dispute could be submitted to the judgment of
      some independent tribunal. Nations are just like people. They see things
      solely from their own point of view. Do you know, Mr. Romayne, there is no
      subject upon which I feel so keenly as upon the subject of war. I just
      loathe and hate and dread the thought of war. I think perhaps I inherit
      this. My mother, you know, belongs to the Friends, and she sees so clearly
      the wickedness and the folly of war. And don't you think that all the
      world is seeing this more clearly to-day than ever before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing new in this argument or in this position to Mr. Romayne,
      but somehow, as he looked at the girl's eager, enthusiastic face, and
      heard her passionate denunciation of war, he found it difficult to defend
      the justice of war under any circumstances whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entirely agree with you, Miss Gwynne, that war is utterly horrible,
      that it is silly, that it is wicked. I would rather not discuss it with
      you, but I can't help feeling that there are circumstances that make it
      necessary and right for men to fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't wish to discuss this with me?" said Kathleen. "I am sorry, for
      I have always wished to hear a soldier who is also"&mdash;the girl
      hesitated for a moment&mdash;"a gentleman and a Christian&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Miss Gwynne," said Romayne, with quiet earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Discuss the reasons why war is ever necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very big subject," said Mr. Romayne, "and some day I should like
      to give you my point of view. There are multitudes of people in Britain
      to-day, Miss Gwynne, who would agree with you. Lots of books have been
      written on both sides. I have listened to hours and hours of discussion,
      so that you can easily see that there is much to be said on both sides. I
      always come back, however, to the point that among nations of similar
      ethical standards and who are equally anxious to preserve the peace of the
      world, arbitration as a method of settling disputes ought to be perfectly
      simple and easy. It is only when you have to deal with nations whose
      standards of ethics are widely dissimilar or who are possessed with
      another ambition than that of preserving the peace of the world that you
      get into difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see your point," replied Kathleen, "but I also see that just there you
      allow for all sorts of prejudice to enter and for the indulgence in unfair
      argument and special pleading. But there, we are finished," she said, "and
      you do not wish to discuss this just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some time, Miss Gwynne, we shall have this out, and I have some
      literature on the subject that I should like to give you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so have I," cried the girl, with a smile that rendered Mr. Romayne
      for some moments quite incapable of consecutive thought. "And now shall we
      look up the others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dump they found Joe and Sam rolling the logs, which during the
      winter had been piled high upon the bank, down the steep declivity or
      "dump" into the stream below. Mrs. Waring-Gaunt and Nora were seated on a
      log beside them engaged in talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I inquire if you are bossing the job as usual?" said Mr. Romayne,
      after he had watched the operation for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, there's no bossing going on to-day. But," said the girl, "I
      rather think the boys like to have me around."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wonder," said Mr. Romayne, enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you making fun of me, Mr. Romayne?" said the girl, her face
      indicating that she was prepared for battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid," replied Mr. Romayne, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it, Nora dear," said his sister. "He is simply consumed with
      envy. He has just come from a country, you know, where only the men do
      things; I mean things that really count. And it makes him furiously
      jealous to see a young woman calmly doing things that he knows quite well
      he could not attempt to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," replied her brother. "I am humbled to the ground at my own
      all to obvious ineptitude, and am lost in admiration of the marvellous
      efficiency of the young ladies of Canada whom it has been my good fortune
      to meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora glanced at him suspiciously. "You talk well," she said. "I half
      believe you're just making fun of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit, Nora, not a bit," said his sister. "It is as I have said
      before. The man is as jealous as he can be, and, like all men, he hates to
      discover himself inferior in any particular to a woman. But we must be
      going. I am so glad you are home again, dear," she said, turning to
      Kathleen. "We shall hope to see a great deal of you. Thank you for the
      delightful lunch. It was so good of you to have us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," added the young man. "You saved my life. I had just about
      reached the final stage of exhaustion. I, too, hope to see you again very
      soon and often, for you know we must finish that discussion and settle
      that question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What question is that," inquired his sister, "if I may ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the old question," said her brother, "the eternal question&mdash;war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," said Nora, "Kathleen has been giving you some of her peace
      talk. I want you to know, Mr. Romayne, that I don't agree with her in the
      least, and I am quite sure you don't either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not so sure of that," replied the young man. "We have not finished
      it out yet. I feel confident, however, that we shall come to an agreement
      on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope not," replied Nora, "for in that case you would become a pacifist,
      for Kathleen, just like mother, you know, is a terrible peace person.
      Indeed, our family is divided on that question&mdash;Daddy and I opposed
      to the rest. And you know pacifists have this characteristic, that they
      are always ready to fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said her sister. "We are always ready to fight for peace. But do
      not let us get into that discussion now. I shall walk with you a little
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arm in arm she and Mrs. Waring-Gaunt walked down the steep trail, Mr.
      Romayne following behind, leading the horses. As they walked together,
      Mrs. Waring-Gaunt talked to the girl of her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know he was in the Diplomatic Service, went in after the South
      African War, and did awfully well there in the reconstruction work, was
      very popular with the Boers, though he had fought them in the war. He got
      to know their big men, and some of them are really big men. As a matter of
      fact, he became very fond of them and helped the Government at Home to see
      things from their point of view. After that he went to the Continent, was
      in Italy for a while and then in Germany, where, I believe, he did very
      good work. He saw a good deal of the men about the Kaiser. He loathed the
      Crown Prince, I believe, as most of our people there do. Suddenly he was
      recalled. He refused, of course, to talk about it, but I understand there
      was some sort of a row. I believe he lost his temper with some exalted
      personage. At any rate, he was recalled, chucked the whole service, and
      came out here. He felt awfully cut up about it. And now he has no faith in
      the German Government, says they mean war. He's awfully keen on
      preparation and that sort of thing. I thought I would just tell you,
      especially since I heard you had been discussing war with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the Switzer place they saw a young man standing on the
      little pier which jutted out into the stream with a pike-pole in his hand,
      keeping the logs from jambing at the turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Ernest Switzer," cried Kathleen. "I have not seen him for ever so
      long. How splendidly he is looking! Hello, Ernest!" she cried, waving her
      hand and running forward to meet him, followed by the critical eyes of
      Jack Romayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man came hurrying toward her. "Kathleen!" he cried. "Is it
      really you?" He threw down his pole as he spoke and took her hand in both
      of his, the flush on his fair face spreading to the roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know Mrs. Waring-Gaunt," said Kathleen to him, for he paid no
      attention at all to the others. Mrs. Waring-Gaunt acknowledged Switzer's
      heel clicks, as also did her brother when introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been keeping the logs running, Ernest, I see. That is very good
      of you," said Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there was the beginning of a nice little jamb here," said Switzer.
      "They are running right enough now. But when did you return?" he
      continued, dropping into a confidential tone and turning his back upon the
      others. "Do you know I have not seen you for nine months?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nine months?" said Kathleen. "I was away seven months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I was away two months before you went. You forget that," he
      added reproachfully. "But I do not forget. Nine months&mdash;nine long
      months. And are you glad to be back, Kathleen, glad to see all your
      friends again, glad to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to be at home, Ernest, glad to see all of my friends, of
      course, glad to get to the West again, to the woods here and the mountains
      and all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you did not come in to see us as you passed," gazing at her with
      reproachful eyes and edging her still further away from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we intended to come in on our way back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's move on," said Romayne to his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must be going, Kathleen dear," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "You will soon
      be coming to see us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, you may be sure. It is so good to see you," replied the girl
      warmly, as Mrs. Waring-Gaunt kissed her good-bye. "Good-bye, Mr. Romayne;
      we must finish our discussion another time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always at your service," replied Mr. Romayne, "although I am rather
      afraid of you. Thank you again for your hospitality. Good-bye." He held
      her hand, looking down into the blue depths of her eyes until as before
      the crimson in her face recalled him. "Good-bye. This has been a wonderful
      day to me." He mounted his horse, lifted his hat, and rode off after his
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a chap is the Johnnie?" said Jack to his sister as they rode
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bad sort at all; very bright fellow, quite popular in this
      community with the young fellows. He has lots of money, you know, and
      spends it. Of course, he is fearfully German, military style and all
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to own that girl, eh?" said Jack, glancing back over his shoulder
      at the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the two families are quite intimate. Ernest and his sister were in
      Larry's musical organisations and they are quite good friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove, Sybil, she is wonderful! Why didn't you give me a hint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. But really, she has come on amazingly. That college in Winnipeg&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, college! It is not a question of college!" said her brother
      impatiently. "It's herself. Why, Sybil, think of that girl in London in a
      Worth frock. But no! That would spoil her. She is better just as she is.
      Jove, she completely knocked me out! I made a fool of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has changed indeed," said his sister. "She is a lovely girl and so
      simple and unaffected. I have come really to love her. We must see a lot
      of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where did she get that perfectly charming manner? Do you realise what
      a perfectly stunning girl she is? Where did she get that style of hers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must see her mother, Jack. She is a charming woman, simple, quiet, a
      Quaker, I believe, but quite beautiful manners. Her father, too, is a
      gentleman, a Trinity man, I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said her brother with a laugh, "I foresee myself falling in love
      with that girl in the most approved style."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might do worse," replied his sister, "though I doubt if you are not
      too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? That German Johnnie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is never wise to despise the enemy. He really is a fine chap,
      his prospects are very good; he has known her for a long while, and he is
      quite mad about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, good Lord, Sybil, he's a German!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A German," said his sister, "yes. But what difference does that make? He
      is a German, but he is also a Canadian. We are all Canadians here whatever
      else we may be or have ever been. We are all sorts and classes, high and
      low, rich and poor, and of all nationalities&mdash;Germans, French,
      Swedes, Galicians, Russians&mdash;but we all shake down into good Canadian
      citizens. We are just Canadians, and that is good enough for me. We are
      loyal to Canada first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be right as far as other nationalities are concerned, but, Sybil,
      believe me, you do not know the German. I know him and there is no such
      thing as a German loyal to Canada first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Jack, you are so terribly insular. You must really get rid of all
      that. I used to think like you, but here we have got to the place where we
      can laugh at all that sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, Sybil. I know. They are laughing in England to-day at Roberts and
      Charlie Beresford. But I know Germany and the German mind and the German
      aim and purpose, and I confess to you that I am in a horrible funk at the
      state of things in our country. And this chap Switzer&mdash;you say he has
      been in Germany for two years? Well, he has every mark characteristic of
      the German. He reproduces the young German that I have seen the world over&mdash;in
      Germany, in the Crown Prince's coterie (don't I know them?), in South
      Africa, in West Africa, in China. He has every mark, the same military
      style, the same arrogant self-assertion, the same brutal disregard of the
      ordinary decencies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Jack, how you talk! You are actually excited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not notice his manner with that girl? He calmly took possession
      of her and ignored us who were of her party, actually isolated her from
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Jack, this seems to me quite outrageous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Sybil, and there are more like you. But I happen to know from
      experience what I am talking about. The elementary governing principle of
      life for the young German of to-day is very simple and is easily
      recognised, and it is this: when you see anything you want, go for it and
      take it, no matter if all the decencies of life are outraged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack, I cannot, frankly, I cannot agree with you in regard to young
      Switzer. I know him fairly well and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's not talk about it, Sybil," said her brother, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode on in silence, Romayne gloomily keeping his eye on the trail
      before him until they neared the Gwynne gate, when the young man exclaimed
      abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, it would be a crime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever do you mean, Jack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To allow that brute to get possession of that lovely girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Jack," persisted his sister. "Brute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sybil, I have seen them with women, their own and other women; and, now
      listen to me, I have yet to see the German who regards or treats his frau
      as an English gentleman treats his wife. That is putting it mildly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to be stopped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, stop it then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to God I could," said her brother.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      YOU FORGOT ME
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Lakeside House, substantially built of logs, with "frame" kitchen
      attached, stood cosily among the clump of trees, poplar and spruce,
      locally described as a bluff. The bluff ran down to the little lake a
      hundred yards away, itself an expansion of Wolf Willow Creek. The
      whitewashed walls gleaming through its festoons of Virginia creeper, a
      little lawn bordered with beds filled with hollyhocks, larkspur,
      sweet-william and other old-fashioned flowers and flanked by a heavy
      border of gorgeous towering sunflowers, gave a general air, not only of
      comfort and thrift, but of refinement as well, too seldom found in
      connection with the raw homesteads of the new western country.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little distance from the house, at the end of a lane leading through
      the bluff, were visible the stables, granary and other outhouses, with
      corral attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, the house fulfilled the promise of its external appearance and
      surroundings. There was dignity without stiffness, comfort without luxury,
      simplicity without any suggestion of the poverty that painfully obtrudes
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the open window whose vine shade at once softened the light and invited
      the summer airs, sat Mrs. Gwynne, with her basket of mending at her side.
      Eight years of life on an Alberta ranch had set their mark upon her. The
      summers' suns and winters' frosts and the eternal summer and winter winds
      had burned and browned the soft, fair skin of her earlier days. The
      anxieties inevitable to the struggle with poverty had lined her face and
      whitened her hair. But her eyes shone still with the serene light of a
      soul that carries within it the secret of triumph over the carking cares
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated beside her was her eldest daughter Kathleen, sewing; and stretched
      upon the floor lay Nora, frankly idle and half asleep, listening to the
      talk of the other two. Their talk turned upon the theme never long absent
      from their thought&mdash;that of ways and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell you what, Mummie," droned Nora, lazily extending her lithe young
      body to its utmost limits, "there is a simple way out of our never ending
      worries, namely, a man, a rich man, if handsome, so much the better, but
      rich he must be, for Kathleen. They say they are hanging round the Gateway
      City of the West in bunches. How about it, Kate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nora," gently chided her mother, "I wish you would not talk in
      that way. It is not quite nice. In my young days&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your young days I know just exactly what happened, Mother. There was
      always a long queue of eligible young men dangling after the awfully
      lovely young Miss Meredith, and before she was well out of her teens the
      gallant young Gwynne carried her off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We never talked about those things, my dear," said her mother, shaking
      her head at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't need to, Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it comes to that, Nora," said her sister, "I don't think you
      need to, very much, either. You have only got to look at&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halt!" cried Nora, springing to her feet. "But seriously, Mother dear, I
      think we can weather this winter right enough. Our food supply is
      practically visible. We have oats enough for man and beast, a couple of
      pigs to kill, a steer also, not to speak of chickens and ducks. We shall
      have some cattle to sell, and if our crops are good we ought to be able to
      pay off those notes. Oh, why will Dad buy machinery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said her mother with gentle reproach, "your father says
      machinery is cheaper than men and we really cannot do without machines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, Mother. I'm not criticising father. He is a perfect
      dear and I am awfully glad he has got that Inspectorship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied her mother, "your father is suited to his new work and
      likes it. And Larry will be finishing his college this year, I think. And
      he has earned it too," continued the mother. "When I think of all he has
      done and how generously he has turned his salary into the family fund, and
      how often he has been disappointed&mdash;" Here her voice trembled a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora dropped quickly to her knees, taking her mother in her arms. "Don't
      we all know, Mother, what he has done? Shall I ever forget those first two
      awful years, the winter mornings when he had to get up before daylight to
      get the house warm, and that awful school. Every day he had to face it,
      rain, sleet, or forty below. How often I have watched him in the school,
      always so white and tired. But he never gave up. He just would not give
      up. And when those big boys were unruly&mdash;I could have killed those
      boys&mdash;he would always keep his temper and joke and jolly them into
      good order. And all the time I knew how terribly his head was aching. What
      are you sniffling about, Kate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it was splendid, just splendid, Nora," cried Kathleen, swiftly
      wiping away her tears. "But I can't help crying, it was all so terrible.
      He never thought of himself, and year after year he gave up his money&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" cried a voice at the door. "Who gave up his money and to whom and
      is there any more around?" His eye glanced around the group. "What's up,
      people? Mummie, are these girls behaving badly? Let me catch them at it!"
      The youth stood smiling down upon them. His years in the West had done
      much for him. He was still slight, but though his face was pale and his
      body thin, his movements suggested muscular strength and sound health. He
      had not grown handsome. His features were irregular, mouth wide, cheek
      bones prominent, ears large; yet withal there was a singular
      attractiveness about his appearance and manner. His eyes were good;
      grey-blue, humorous, straight-looking eyes they were, deep set under
      overhanging brows, and with a whimsical humour ever lingering about them;
      over the eyes a fore-head, broad, suggesting intellect, and set off by
      heavy, waving, dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who gave his money? I insist upon knowing. No reply, eh? I have evidently
      come upon a deep and deadly plot. Mother?&mdash;no use asking you.
      Kathleen, out with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You gave your money," burst forth Nora in a kind of passion as she flew
      at him, "and everything else. But now that's all over. You are going to
      finish your college course this year, that's what."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's it, eh? I knew there was some women's scheme afloat. Well,
      children," said the youth, waving his hand over them in paternal
      benediction, "since this thing is up we might as well settle it 'right
      here and n-a-o-w,' as our American friend, Mr. Ralph Waldo Farwell, would
      say, and a decent sort he is too. I have thought this all out. Why should
      not a man gifted with a truly great brain replete with grey matter (again
      in the style of the aforesaid Farwell) do the thinking for his wimmin
      folk? Why not? Hence the problem is already solved. The result is hereby
      submitted, not for discussion but for acceptance, for acceptance you
      understand, to-wit and namely, as Dad's J. P. law books have it: I shall
      continue the school another year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shan't," shouted Nora, seizing him by the arm and shaking him with
      all the strength of her vigorous young body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry, dear!" said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry!" exclaimed Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall then be able to pay off all our indebtedness," continued Larry,
      ignoring their protests, "and that is a most important achievement. This
      new job of Dad's means an addition to our income. The farm management will
      remain in the present capable hands. No, Miss Nora, I am not thinking of
      the boss, but of the head, the general manager." He waved his hand toward
      his mother. "The only change will be in the foreman. A new appointment
      will be made, one who will bring to her task not only experience and with
      it a practical knowledge, but the advantage of intellectual discipline
      recently acquired at a famous educational centre; and the whole concern
      will go on with its usual verve, swing, snap, toward another year's
      success. Then next year me for the giddy lights of the metropolitan city
      and the sacred halls of learning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me," said Nora, "what does your high mightiness plan for me this
      winter, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so much truculence, young lady," replied her brother. "For you,
      the wide, wide world, a visit to the seat of light and learning already
      referred to, namely, Winnipeg."
    </p>
    <p>
      For one single moment Nora looked at him. Then, throwing back her head,
      she said with unsteady voice: "Not this time, old boy. One man can lead a
      horse to water but ten cannot make him drink, and you may as well
      understand now as later that this continual postponement of your college
      career is about to cease. We have settled it otherwise. Kathleen will take
      your school&mdash;an awful drop for the kids, but what joy for the big
      boys. She and I will read together in the evenings. The farm will go on.
      Sam and Joe are really very good and steady; Joe at least, and Sam most of
      the time. Dad's new work will not take him from home so much, he says. And
      next year me for the fine arts and the white lights of Winnipeg. That's
      all that needs to be said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, dear," said the mother, looking at her son, "Nora is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mother," exclaimed Larry, "I don't like to hear your foot come down
      just yet. I know that tone of finality, but listen&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have listened," said Kathleen, "and we know we are right. I shall take
      the school, Mr. Farwell&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Farwell, eh?&mdash;" exclaimed Nora significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Farwell has promised me," continued Kathleen, "indeed has offered me,
      the school. Nora and I can study together. I shall keep up my music. Nora
      will keep things going outside, mother will look after every thing as
      usual, Dad will help us outside and in. So that's settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Settled!" cried her brother. "You are all terribly settling. It seems to
      me that you apparently forget&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the mother interposed. "Larry, dear, Kathleen has put it very
      well. Your father and I have talked it over"&mdash;the young people
      glanced at each other and smiled at this ancient and well-worn phrase&mdash;"we
      have agreed that it is better that you should finish your college this
      winter. Of course we know you would suggest delay, but we are anxious that
      you should complete your course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mother, listen&mdash;" began Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Larry, 'children, obey your parents' is still valid," said
      Nora. "What are you but a child after all, though with your teaching and
      your choral society conducting, and your nigger show business, and your
      preaching in the church, and your popularity, you are getting so uplifted
      that there's no holding you. Just make up your mind to do your duty, do
      you hear? Your duty. Give up this selfish determination to have your own
      way, this selfish pleasing of yourself." Abruptly she paused, rushed at
      him, threw her arms around his neck, and kissed him. "You darling old
      humbug," she said with a very unsteady voice. "There, I will be blubbering
      in a minute. I am off for the timber lot. What do you say, Katty? It's
      cooler now. We'll go up the cool road. Are you coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; wait until I change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, I will saddle up. You coming, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'll catch up later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mother," warned Nora, "I know his ways and wiles. Remember your duty
      to your children. You are also inclined to be horribly selfish. Be firm.
      Hurry up, Kate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with his mother, Larry went deliberately to work with her. Well
      he knew the immovable quality of her resolution when once her mind was
      made up. Patiently, quietly, steadily, he argued with her, urging Nora's
      claims for a year at college.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She needs a change after her years of hard work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her education was incomplete; the ground work was sound enough, but she
      had come to the age when she must have those finishing touches that girls
      require to fit them for their place in life. "She is a splendid girl, but
      in some ways still a child needing discipline; in other ways mature, too
      mature. She ought to have her chance and ought to have it now." One never
      knew what would happen in the case of girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother sighed. "Poor Nora, she has had discipline enough of a kind,
      and hard discipline it has been indeed for you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Mother, we have had a perfectly fine time together, all of us.
      God knows if any one has had a hard time it is not the children in this
      home. I do not like to think of those awful winters, Mother, and of the
      hard time you had with us all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hard time!" exclaimed his mother. "I, a hard time, and with you all
      here beside me, and all so well and strong? What more could I want?" The
      amazed surprise in her face stirred in her son a quick rush of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother," he whispered in her ear. "There is no one
      like you. Did you ever in all your life seek one thing for yourself, one
      thing, one little thing? Away back there in Ontario you slaved and slaved
      and went without things yourself that all the rest of us might get them.
      Here it has been just the same. Haven't I seen your face and your hands,
      your poor hands,"&mdash;here the boy's voice broke with an indignant
      passion&mdash;"blue with the cold when you could not get furs to protect
      them? Never, never shall I forget those days." The boy stopped abruptly,
      unable to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly the mother drew her son toward her. "Larry, my son, my son, you
      must never think that a hard time. Did ever a woman have such joy as I?
      When I think of other mothers and of other children, and then think of you
      all here, I thank God every day and many times a day that he has given us
      each other. And, Larry, my son, let me say this, and you will remember it
      afterwards. You have been a continual joy to me, always, always. You have
      never given me a moment's anxiety or pain. Remember that. I continually
      thank God for you. You have made my life very happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy put his face down on her lap with his arms tight around her waist.
      Never in their life together had they been able to open these deep, sacred
      chambers in their souls to each other's gaze. For some moments he remained
      thus, then lifting up his face, he kissed her again and again, her
      forehead, her eyes, her lips. Then rising to his feet, he stood with his
      usual smile about his lips. "You always beat me. But will you not think
      this all over again carefully, and we will do what you say? But will you
      promise, Mother, to think it over again and look at my side of it too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Larry, I promise," said his mother. "Now run after the girls, and I
      shall have tea ready for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Larry rode down the lane he saw the young German, Ernest Switzer, and
      his sister riding down the trail and gave them a call. They pulled up and
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Ernest; whither bound? How are you, Dorothea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home," said the young man, "and you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going up by the timber lot, around by the cool road. The girls are on
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, so?" said the young man, evidently waiting for an invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you care to come? It's not much longer that way," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might," said the young man. Then looking doubtfully at his sister, "You
      cannot come very well, Dorothea, can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that is, I'm afraid not," she replied. She was a pretty girl with
      masses of yellow hair, light blue eyes, a plump, kindly face and a timid
      manner. As she spoke she, true to her German training, evidently waited
      for an indication of her brother's desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are the cows, you know," continued her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there are the cows," her face clouding as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, rot!" said Larry, "you don't milk until evening, and we get back
      before tea. Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the girl hesitated. "Well," said her brother brusquely, "do you want
      to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced timidly at his rather set face and then at Larry. "I don't
      know. I am afraid that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come along, Dorothea, do you hear me telling you? You will be in
      plenty of time and your brother will help you with the milking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ernest help! Oh, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on your life!" said that young man. "I never milk. I haven't for
      years. Well, come along then," he added in a grudging voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is fine," said Larry. "But, Dorothea, you ought to make him learn to
      milk. Why shouldn't he? The lazy beggar. Do you mean to say that he never
      helps with the milking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never," said Dorothea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our men don't do women's work," said Ernest. "It is not the German way.
      It is not fitting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about women doing men's work?" said Larry. "It seems to me I
      have seen German women at work in the fields up in the Settlement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt you have," replied Ernest stiffly. "It is the German
      custom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me tired," said Larry, "the German custom indeed! Does that make
      it right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For us, yes," replied Ernest calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are Canadians, are you not? Are there to be different standards
      in Canada for different nationalities?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the Germans will follow the German way. Because it is German, and
      demonstrated through experience to be the best. Look at our people. Look
      at our prosperity at home, at our growth in population, at our wealth, at
      our expansion in industry and commerce abroad. Look at our social
      conditions and compare them with those in this country or in any other
      country in the world. Who will dare to say that German methods and German
      customs are not best, at least for Germans? But let us move a little
      faster, otherwise we shall never catch up with them." He touched his
      splendid broncho into a sharp gallop, the other horses following more
      slowly behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is very German, my brother," said Dorothea. "He thinks he is Canadian,
      but he is not the same since he went over Home. He is talking all the time
      about Germany, Germany, Germany. I hate it." Her blue eyes flashed fire
      and her usually timid voice vibrated with an intense feeling. Larry gazed
      at her in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may look at me, Larry," she cried. "I am German but I do not like the
      German ways. I like the Canadian ways. The Germans treat their women like
      their cows. They feed them well, they keep them warm because&mdash;because&mdash;they
      have calves&mdash;I mean the cows&mdash;and the women have kids. I hate
      the German ways. Look at my mother. What is she in that house? Day and
      night she has worked, day and night, saving money&mdash;and what for? For
      Ernest. Running to wait on him and on Father and they never know it. It's
      women's work with us to wait on men, and that is the way in the Settlement
      up there. Look at your mother and you. Mein Gott! I could kill them, those
      men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Dorothea, you amaze me. What's up with you? I never heard you talk
      like this. I never knew that you felt like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, how could you know? Who would tell you? Not Ernest," she replied
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Dorothea, you are happy, are you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy, I was until I knew better, till two years ago when I saw your
      mother and you with her. Then Ernest came back thinking himself a German
      officer&mdash;he is an officer, you know&mdash;and the way he treated our
      mother and me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treated your mother! Surely he is not unkind to your mother?" Larry had a
      vision of a meek, round-faced, kindly, contented woman, who was obviously
      proud of her only son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kind, kind," cried Dorothea, "he is kind as German sons are kind. But you
      cannot understand. Why did I speak to you of this? Yes, I will tell you
      why," she added, apparently taking a sudden resolve. "Let's go slowly.
      Ernest is gone anyway. I will tell you why. Before Ernest went away he was
      more like a Canadian boy. He was good to his mother. He is good enough
      still but&mdash;oh, it is so hard to show you. I have seen you and your
      mother. You would not let your mother brush your boots for you, you would
      not sit smoking and let her carry in wood in the winter time, you would
      not stand leaning over the fence and watch your mother milk the cow. Mein
      Gott! Ernest, since he came back&mdash;the women are only good for waiting
      on him, for working in the house or on the farm. His wife, she will not
      work in the fields; Ernest is too rich for that. But she will not be like"&mdash;here
      the girl paused abruptly, a vivid colour dyeing her fair skin&mdash;"like
      your wife. I would die sooner than marry a German man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Ernest is not like that, Dorothea. He is not like that with my
      sisters. Why, he is rather the other way, awfully polite and all that sort
      of thing, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's the way with young German gentlemen to young ladies, that is,
      other people's ladies. But to their own, no. And I must tell you. Oh, I am
      afraid to tell you," she added breathlessly. "But I will tell you, you
      have been so kind, so good to me. You are my friend, and you will not
      tell. Promise me you will never tell." The girl's usually red face was
      pale, her voice was hoarse and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, Dorothea? Of course I won't tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ernest wants to marry your sister, Kathleen. He is just mad to get her,
      and he always gets his way too. I would not like to see your sister his
      wife. He would break her heart and," she added in a lower voice, "yours
      too. But remember you are not to tell. You are not to let him know I told
      you." A real terror shone in her eyes. "Do you hear me?" she cried. "He
      would beat me with his whip. He would, he would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beat you, beat you?" Larry pulled up his horse short. "Beat you in this
      country&mdash;oh, Dorothea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do. Our men do beat their women, and Ernest would too. The women do
      not think the same way about it as your women. You will not tell?" she
      urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think I am, Dorothea? And as for beating you, let me catch
      him. By George, I'd, I'd&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, her pale face
      flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry laughed. "Well, he's a big chap, but I'd try to knock his block off.
      But it's nonsense. Ernest is not that kind. He's an awfully good sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, he is a good sort, but he is also a German officer and, ah, you
      cannot understand, but do not let him have your sister. I have told you.
      Come, let us go quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode on in silence, but did not overtake the others until they
      reached the timber lot where they found the party waiting. With what
      Dorothea had just told him in his mind, Larry could not help a keen
      searching of Kathleen's face. She was quietly chatting with the young
      German, with face serene and quite untouched with anything but the
      slightest animation. "She is not worrying over anything," said Larry to
      himself. Then he turned and looked upon the face of the young man at her
      side. A shock of surprise, of consternation, thrilled him. The young man's
      face was alight with an intensity of eagerness, of desire, that startled
      Larry and filled him with a new feeling of anxiety, indeed of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you people are slow," cried Nora. "What is keeping you? Come along or
      we shall be late. Shall we go through the woods straight to the dump, or
      shall we go around?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go around," cried Kathleen. "Do you know I have not been around for
      ever so long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Larry, "let's go around by Nora's mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora's mine!" exclaimed Ernest. "Do you know I've heard about that mine a
      great deal but I have never seen Nora's mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, then," said Nora, "but there's almost no trail and we shall
      have to hurry while we can. There's only a cow track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Move along then," said her brother; "show us the way and we will follow.
      Go on, Ernest."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ernest apparently had difficulty with his broncho so that he was found
      at the rear of the line with Kathleen immediately in front of him. The cow
      trail led out of the coolee over a shoulder of a wooded hill and down into
      a ravine whose sharp sides made the riding even to those experienced
      westerners a matter of difficulty, in places of danger. At the bottom of
      the ravine a little torrent boiled and foamed on its way to join Wolf
      Willow Creek a mile further down. After an hour's struggle with the
      brushwood and fallen timber the party was halted by a huge spruce tree
      which had fallen fair across the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where now, boss?" cried Larry to Nora, who from her superior knowledge of
      the ground, had been leading the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is something new," answered Nora. "I think we should cross the water
      and try to break through to the left around the top of the tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Ernest, "the right looks better to me, around the root here. It
      is something of a scramble, but it is better than the left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along," said Nora; "this is the way of the trail, and we can get
      through the brush of that top all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am for the right. Come, let's try it, Kathleen, shall we?" said Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen hesitated. "Come, we'll beat them out. Right turn, march."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commanding tones of the young man appeared to dominate the girl. She
      set her horse to the steep hillside, following her companion to the right.
      A steep climb through a tangle of underbrush brought them into the cleared
      woods, where they paused to breathe their animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that was splendidly done. You are a good horsewoman," said Ernest.
      "If you only had a horse as good as mine we could go anywhere together.
      You deserve a better horse, too. I wonder if you know how fine you look."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear old Kitty is not very quick nor very beautiful, but she is very
      faithful, and so kind," said Kathleen, reaching down and patting her mare
      on the nose. "Shall we go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We need not hurry," replied her companion. "We have beaten them already.
      I love the woods here, and, Kathleen, I have not seen you for ever so
      long, for nine long months. And since your return fifteen days ago I have
      seen you only once, only once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," said Kathleen, hurrying her horse a little. "We happened to
      be out every time you called."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Other people have seen you," continued the young man with a note almost
      of anger in his voice. "Everywhere I hear of you, but I cannot see you. At
      church&mdash;I go to church to see you&mdash;but that, that Englishman is
      with you. He walks with you, you go in his motor car, he is in your house
      every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about, Ernest? Mr. Romayne? Of course. Mother likes
      him so much, and we all like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother, ah!" Ernest's tone was full of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my mother&mdash;we all like him, and his sister, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt,
      you know. They are our nearest neighbours, and we have come to know them
      very well. Shall we go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen, listen to me," said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point a long call came across the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there they are," cried the girl. "Let's hurry, please do." She
      brought her whip down unexpectedly on Kitty's shoulders. The mare,
      surprised at such unusual treatment from her mistress, sprang forward,
      slipped on the moss-covered sloping rock, plunged, recovered herself,
      slipped again, and fell over on her side. At her first slip, the young man
      was off his horse, and before the mare finally pitched forward was at her
      head, and had caught the girl from the saddle into his arms. For a moment
      she lay there white and breathing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, Kathleen!" he cried. "You are hurt? You might have been killed."
      His eyes burned like two blazing lights, his voice was husky, his face
      white. Suddenly crushing her to him, he kissed her on the cheek and again
      on her lips. The girl struggled to get free.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let me go, let me go," she cried. "How can you, how can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But his arms were like steel about her, and again and again he continued
      to kiss her, until, suddenly relaxing, she lay white and shuddering in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen," he said, his voice hoarse with passion, "I love you, I love
      you. I want you. Gott in Himmel, I want you. Open your eyes, Kathleen, my
      darling. Speak to me. Open your eyes. Look at me. Tell me you love me."
      But still she lay white and shuddering. Suddenly he released her and set
      her on her feet. She stood looking at him with quiet, searching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love me," she said, her voice low and quivering with a passionate
      scorn, "and you treat me so? Let us go." She moved toward her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen, hear me," he entreated. "You must hear me. You shall hear me."
      He caught her once more by the arm. "I forgot myself. I saw you lying
      there so white. How could I help it? I meant no harm. I have loved you
      since you were a little girl, since that day I saw you first herding the
      cattle. You had a blue dress and long braids. I loved you then. I have
      loved you every day since. I think of you and I dream of you. The world is
      full of you. I am offering you marriage. I want you to be my wife." The
      hands that clutched her arm were shaking, his voice was thick and broken.
      But still she stood with her face turned from him, quietly trying to break
      from his grasp. But no word did she speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen, I forgot myself," he said, letting go of her arm. "I was wrong,
      but, my God, Kathleen, I am not stone, and when I felt your heart beat
      against mine&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she cried, shuddering and drawing further away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;and your face so white, your dear face so near mine, I forgot
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the girl, turning her face toward him and searching him with
      her quiet, steady, but contemptuous eyes, "you forgot me."

      CHAPTER IX

    <h3>
      EXCEPT HE STRIVE LAWFULLY
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Wolf Willow Dominion Day Celebration Committee were in session in the
      schoolhouse with the Reverend Evans Rhye in the chair, and all of the
      fifteen members in attendance. The reports from the various sub-committees
      had been presented and approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The programme for the day was in the parson's hand. "A fine programme,
      ladies and gentlemen, thanks to you all, and especially to our friend
      here," said Mr. Rhye, placing his hand on Larry's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of approval greeted his remark, but Larry protested. "Not at all.
      Every one was keen to help. We are all tremendous Canadians and eager to
      celebrate Dominion Day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us go over it again," said Mr. Rhye. "The football match with
      the Eagle Hill boys is all right. How about the polo match with the High
      River men, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The captain of the High River team wrote to express regret that two of
      his seniors would not be available, but that he hoped to give us a decent
      game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will only be one fault with the dinner and the tea, Mrs. Kemp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what will that be, sir?" enquired Mrs. Kemp, who happened to be
      Convener of the Refreshment Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will receive far too much for their money," said Mr. Rhye. "How
      about the evening entertainment, Larry?" he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is all right, I think, sir," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are the minstrels in good form?" enquired Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "This is
      your last appearance, you know, and you must go out in a blaze of glory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hope to get through somehow," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the speakers?" enquired Mr. Rhye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both will be on hand. Mr. Gilchrist promises a patriotic address. Mr.
      Alvin P. Jones will represent Wolf Willow in a kind of local glorification
      stunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all perfectly splendid," said Mr. Rhye, "and I cannot tell you
      how grateful I am to you all. We ought to have a memorable day to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      And a memorable day it was. The weather proved worthy of Alberta's best
      traditions, for it was sunny, with a fine sweeping breeze to temper the
      heat and to quicken the pulses with its life-bringing ozone fresh from the
      glacier gorges and the pine forests of the Rockies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the Wolf Willow football team was awake and afoot soon
      after break of day that he might be in readiness for the Eagle Hill team
      when they arrived. Sam was in his most optimistic mood. His team, he knew,
      were in the finest condition and fit for their finest effort. Everything
      promised victory. But alas! for Sam's hopes. At nine o'clock a staggering
      blow fell when Vial, his partner on the right wing of the forward line,
      rode over with the news that Coleman, their star goal-keeper, their
      ultimate reliance on the defence line, had been stepped on by a horse and
      rendered useless for the day. It was, indeed, a crushing calamity. Sam
      spent an hour trying to dig up a substitute. The only possible substitutes
      were Hepworth and Biggs, neither of them first class men but passable, and
      Fatty Rose. The two former, however, had gone for the day to Calgary, and
      Fatty Rose was hopelessly slow. Sam discussed the distressing situation
      with such members of the team as could be hastily got together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dere's dat new feller," suggested Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," said Vial, familiarly known as Bottles. "That chap Sykes,
      Farwell's friend. He's a dandy dribbler. He could take Cassap's place on
      left wing and let Cassap take goal."
    </p>
    <p>
      With immense relief the team accepted this solution of the difficulty. But
      gloom still covered Sam's face. "He's only been here two weeks," he said,
      "and you know darn well the rule calls for four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hang it!" said Bottles, "he's going to be a resident all right. He's
      a real resident right now, and anyway, they won't know anything about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, cut it out," said Sam, suddenly flaring into wrath. "You know we
      can't do that sort of thing. It ain't the game and we ain't goin' to do
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ain't the game?" enquired Larry, who had come upon the anxious and
      downcast group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farwell told him the calamitous news and explained the problem under
      discussion. "We'd play Sykes, only he hasn't been here a month yet, and
      Sam won't stand for it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course Sam won't stand for it, and the Captain is right," said Larry.
      "Is there nobody else, Sam?" Sam shook his head despondently. "Would I be
      any good, Sam? I am not keen about it, but if you think I could take
      Cassap's place on left wing, he could take goal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam brightened up a little. "Guess we can't do no better," he said
      doubtfully. "I mean," he added in answer to the shout of laughter from the
      team&mdash;"Aw, shut up, can that cackle. We know the Master hates
      football an' this is goin' to be a real fightin' game. He'll get all
      knocked about an' I don't want that. You know he'll be takin' all kinds of
      chances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, quit, Sam. I am in pretty good shape," said Larry. "They can't kill
      me. That's the best I can do anyway, so let's get to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was sufficiently gloomy to stir Joe to his supremest efforts
      and to kindle Sam's spirit to a blazing flame. "We don't need Sykes nor
      nobody else," he shouted to his men as they moved on to the field. "They
      can wear their boots out on that defence line of ours an' be derned to
      'em. An', Bottles, you got to play the game of your life to-day. None of
      your fancy embroidery, just plain knittin'. Every feller on the ball an'
      every feller play to his man. There'll be a lot of females hangin' around,
      but we don't want any frills for the girls to admire. But all at it an'
      all the time." Sam's little red eyes glowed with even a more fiery hue
      than usual; his rat-like face assumed its most belligerent aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the match Larry took the Eagle Hill captain, a young Englishman who
      had been trying for ten years to make a living on a ranch far up among the
      foothills and was only beginning to succeed, to his mother, who had been
      persuaded to witness the game. They found her in Kathleen's care and under
      instruction from young Farwell as to the fundamental principles of the
      game. Near them a group of men were standing, among whom were Switzer,
      Waring-Gaunt, and Jack Romayne, listening to Farwell's dissertation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Mrs. Gwynne," he said, "no one may handle the ball&mdash;head,
      feet, body, may be used, but not the hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I understand they sometimes hurt each other, Mr. Farwell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, accidents will happen even on the farm, Mrs. Gwynne. For instance,
      Coleman this morning had a horse step on his foot, necessitating Larry's
      going on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Lawrence going to play?" said Mrs. Gwynne. "Ah, here he is. Lawrence,
      are you in good condition? You have not been playing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not really very fit, Mother, not very hard, but I have been running
      a good deal. I don't expect I shall be much use. Sam is quite dubious
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be all right, Mrs. Gwynne," said Farwell confidently. "He is the
      fastest runner in the team. If he were only twenty pounds heavier and if
      he were a bit more keen about the game he would be a star."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't they play Sykes?" inquired Kathleen. "I heard some of the boys
      say this morning that Sykes was going to play. He is quite wonderful, I
      believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," replied Larry, "quite wonderful, but unfortunately he is not
      eligible. But let me introduce Mr. Duckworth, Captain of our enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwynne received the young man with a bright smile. "I am sorry I
      cannot wish you victory, and all the more now that my own son is to be
      engaged. But I don't understand, Larry," she continued, "why Mr. Sykes
      cannot play."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, because there's a League regulation, Mother, that makes a month's
      residence in the district necessary to a place on the team. Unfortunately
      Sykes has been here only two weeks, and so we are unwilling to put one
      over on our gallant foe. Got to play the game, eh, Duckworth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Duckworth's face grew fiery red. "Yes, certainly," he said. "Rather an
      awkward rule but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Mother, we want to eliminate every sign of professionalism,"
      said Larry, "and emphasise the principle of local material for clubs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see, and a very good idea, I should say," said his mother. "The
      Eagle Hill team, for instance, will be made up of Eagle Hill men only.
      That is really much better for the game because you get behind your team
      all the local pride and enthusiasm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A foolish rule, I call it," said Switzer abruptly to Kathleen, "and you
      can't enforce it anyway. Who can tell the personality of a team ten,
      twenty or fifty miles away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy they can tell themselves," said Jack Romayne. "Their Captain can
      certify to his men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" laughed Switzer. "That's good. The Captain, I suppose, is keen to
      win. Do you think he would keep a man off his team who is his best player,
      and who may bring him the game?" Switzer's face was full of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it they are gentlemen," was Romayne's quiet rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Mr. Romayne," said Mrs. Gwynne. "That gets rid of all the
      difficulty. Otherwise it seems to me that all the pleasure would be gone
      from the contest, the essential condition of which is keeping to the
      rules."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you, Mother. You're a real sport," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," replied his mother, "we have Scripture for it. You remember
      what it says? 'If a man strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except
      he strive lawfully.' 'Except he strive lawfully,' you see. The crown he
      might otherwise win would bring neither honour nor pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good again, Mother. You ought to have a place on the League committee. We
      shall have that Scripture entered on the rules. But I must run and dress.
      Farwell, you can take charge of Duckworth."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Duckworth was uneasy to be gone. "If you will excuse me, Mrs. Gwynne,
      I must get my men together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Duckworth," said Mrs. Gwynne, smiling on him as she gave him
      her hand, "I am sorry we cannot wish you a victory, but we can wish you
      your very best game and an honourable defeat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Duckworth. "I feel you have done your best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and see us afterward, Mr. Duckworth. What a splendid young man," she
      continued, as Duckworth left the party and set off to get his men together
      with the words "except he strive lawfully" ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a wonder," he said to himself. "I wonder how it is she got to me as
      she has. I know. She makes me think&mdash;" But Duckworth refused even to
      himself to say of whom she made him think. "Except he strive lawfully" the
      crown would bring "neither honour nor pleasure." Those words, and the face
      which had suddenly been recalled to Duckworth's memory reconstructed his
      whole scheme of football diplomacy. "By George, we cannot play Liebold; we
      can't do it. The boys will kick like steers, but how can we? I'm up
      against a fierce proposition, all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he found when he called his men together and put to them the
      problem before him. "It seems a rotten time to bring this matter up just
      when we are going on to the ground, but I never really thought much about
      it till that little lady put it to me as I told you. And, fellows, I have
      felt as if it were really up to me to put it before you. They have lost
      their goal man, Coleman&mdash;there's no better in the League&mdash;and
      because of this infernal rule they decline to put on a cracking good
      player. They are playing the game on honour, and they are expecting us to
      do the same, and as that English chap says, they expect us to be
      gentlemen. I apologise to you all, and if you say go on as we are, I will
      go on because I feel I ought to have kicked before. But I do so under
      protest and feeling like a thief. I suggest that Harremann take Liebold's
      place. Awfully sorry about it, Liebold, and I apologise to you. I can't
      tell you how sorry I am, boys, but that's how it is with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time for discussion, and strangely enough there was little
      desire for it, the Captain's personality and the action of the Wolf Willow
      team carrying the proposition through. Harremann took his place on the
      team, and Liebold made his contribution that day from the side lines. But
      the team went on to the field with a sense that whatever might be the
      outcome of the match they had begun the day with victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The match was contested with the utmost vigour, not to say violence; but
      there was a absence of the rancour which had too often characterised the
      clashing of these teams on previous occasions, the Eagle Hill team
      carrying on to the field a new respect for their opponents as men who had
      shown a true sporting spirit. And by the time the first quarter was over
      their action in substituting an inferior player for Liebold for honour's
      sake was known to all the members of the Wolf Willow team, and awakened in
      them and in their friends among the spectators a new respect for their
      enemy. The match resulted in a victory for the home team, but the generous
      applause which followed the Eagle Hill team from the field and which
      greeted them afterward at the dinner where they occupied an honoured place
      at the table set apart for distinguished guests, and the excellent dinner
      provided by the thrifty Ladies' Aid of All Saints Church went far to
      soothe their wounded spirits and to atone for their defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully fine of you, Duckworth," said Larry, as they left the table
      together. "That's the sort of thing that makes for clean sport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised to see your mother after the match," said Duckworth. "Can we
      find her now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwynne received the young man with hand stretched far out to meet
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You made us lose the game, Mrs. Gwynne," said Duckworth in a half-shamed
      manner, "and that is one reason why I came to see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" exclaimed Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you quoted Scripture against us, and you know you can't stand up
      against Scripture and hope to win, can you?" said Duckworth with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down here beside me, Mr. Duckworth," she said, her eyes shining. "I
      won't pretend not to understand you;" she continued when he had taken his
      place beside her. "I can't tell you how proud I am of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Duckworth. "I like to hear that. You see I never thought
      about it very much. I am not excusing myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I know you are not, but I heard about it, Mr. Duckworth. We all think
      so much of you. I am sure your mother is proud of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Duckworth sat silent, his eyes fastened upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please forgive me. Perhaps she is&mdash;no longer with you," said Mrs.
      Gwynne softly, laying her hand upon his. Duckworth nodded, refusing to
      look at her and keeping his lips firmly pressed together. "I was wrong in
      what I said just now," she continued. "She is with you still; she knows
      and follows all your doings, and I believe she is proud of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duckworth cleared his throat and said with an evident effort, "You made me
      think of her to-day, and I simply had to play up. I must go now. I must
      see the fellows." He rose quickly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and see us, won't you?" said Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't I just," replied Duckworth, holding her hand a moment or two. "I
      can't tell you how glad I am that I met you to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, wait, Mr. Duckworth. Nora, come here. I want you to meet my second
      daughter. Nora, this is Mr. Duckworth, the Captain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know him, the Captain of the enemy," cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of our friends, Nora," said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, of our friends, now that we have beaten you, but I want to
      tell you, Mr. Duckworth, that I could gladly have slain you many times
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you were so terribly dangerous, and as for Larry, why you just played
      with him. It was perfectly maddening to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same your brother got away from me and shot the winning goal.
      He's fearfully fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere fluke, I tell him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think it for one little minute. It was a neat bit of work."

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SPIRIT Of CANADA
    </h3>
    <p>
      Whatever it was that rendered it necessary for Duckworth to "see the
      fellows," that necessity vanished in the presence of Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to take in the polo?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I? Am I going to continue breathing?" cried Nora. "Come along, Mother,
      we must go if we are to get a good place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I find one for you," said Mr. Duckworth, quite forgetting that he
      "must see the fellows," and thinking only of his good luck in falling in
      with such a "stunning-looking girl." He himself had changed into flannels,
      and with his athletic figure, his brown, healthy face, brown eyes and
      hair, was a thoroughly presentable young man. He found a place with ease
      for his party, a dozen people offering to make room for them. As Mr.
      Duckworth let his eyes rest upon the young lady at his side his sense of
      good-fortune grew upon him, for Nora in white pique skirt and batiste
      blouse smartly girdled with a scarlet patent leather belt, in white canvas
      shoes and sailor hat, made a picture good to look at. Her dark olive brown
      skin, with rich warm colour showing through the sunburn of her cheeks, her
      dark eyes, and her hair for once "done up in style" under Kathleen's
      supervision, against the white of her costume made her indeed what her
      escort thought, "a stunning-looking girl." Usually careless as to her
      appearance, she had yielded to Kathleen's persuasion and had "gotten
      herself up to kill." No wonder her friends of both sexes followed her with
      eyes of admiration, for no one envied Nora, her frank manner, her generous
      nature, her open scorn at all attempts to win admiration, made her only
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring your mother over here," cried Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, who rejoiced
      exceedingly in the girl's beauty. "Why, how splendidly you are looking
      to-day," she continued in a more confidential tone as the party grouped
      themselves about her. "What have you been doing to yourself? You are
      looking awfully fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" said Nora, exceedingly pleased with herself. "I am awfully glad.
      It is all Kathleen's doing. I got me the belt and the hat new for this
      show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very smart, that belt, my dear," said her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather fancy it myself, and Kathleen would do up my hair in this new
      way," said Nora, removing her hat that the full glory of her coiffure
      might appear. "Do you like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly spiffing!" ejaculated Mr. Duckworth, who had taken a seat just
      behind her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora threw him a challenging glance that made that young man's heart skip
      a beat or two as all the excitements of the match had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a judge?" said the girl, tipping her saucy chin at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I? With four sisters and dozens of cousins to practise on, I fancy I
      might claim to be a regular bench show expert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," cried Nora with sudden animation, "you are the very man I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much," replied Mr. Duckworth fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, perhaps you can advise me. Now as you look at me&mdash;" The
      young man's eyes burned into hers so that with all her audacity Nora felt
      the colour rising in her face. "Which would you suggest as the most
      suitable style for me, the psyche knot or the neck roll?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon? I rather&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or would you say the French twist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the French twist&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or simply marcelled and pomped?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or perhaps the pancake or the coronet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the young man, desperately plunging, "the coronet I should
      say would certainly not be inappropriate. It goes with princesses,
      duchesses and that sort of thing. Don't you think so, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt?"
      said Duckworth, hoping to be extricated. That lady, however, gave him no
      assistance but continued to smile affectionately at the girl beside her.
      "What style is this that you have now adopted, may I ask?" inquired Mr.
      Duckworth cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's a combination of several. It's a creation of Kathleen's which
      as yet has received no name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it should be named at once," said Duckworth with great emphasis.
      "May I suggest the Thunderbolt? You see, of course&mdash;so stunning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are coming on," cried Nora, turning her shoulder in disdain upon the
      young man. "Look, there's your brother, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. I think he is
      perfectly splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is he?" said Mr. Duckworth, acutely interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That tall, fine-looking man on the brown pony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I see. Met him this morning. By Jove, he is some looker too,"
      replied Mr. Duckworth with reluctant enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is the High River Captain," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "on the
      grey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Monteith, he played for All Canada last year, didn't he?" said
      Nora with immense enthusiasm. "He is perfectly splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear the High River club has really sent only its second team, or at
      least two of them," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "Certainly Tremaine is not
      with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope they get properly trimmed for it," said Nora, indignantly. "Such
      cheek!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the match quite exceeded Nora's fondest hopes, for the High
      River team, having made the fatal error of despising the enemy, suffered
      the penalty of their mistake in a crushing defeat. It was certainly a
      memorable day for Wolf Willow, whose inhabitants were exalted to a height
      of glory as they never experienced in all their history.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serves us right," said Monteith, the High River Captain, apologising for
      his team's poor display to his friend, Hec Ross, who had commanded the
      Wolf Willow team. "We deserved to be jolly well licked, and we got what
      was coming to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we're not worrying," replied the Wolf Willow Captain, himself a
      sturdy horseman and one of the most famous stick handlers in the West. "Of
      course, we know that if Murray and Knight had been with you the result
      would have been different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not at all sure about that," replied Monteith. "That new man of
      yours, Romayne, is a wonder. Army man, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, played in India, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no wonder he's such a don at it. You ought to get together a great
      team here, Ross, and I should like to bring our team down again to give
      you a real game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say two weeks. No. That throws it a little late for the harvest. Say a
      week from to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall let you know to-night," said Ross. "You are staying for the
      spellbinding fest and entertainment, are you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing; we are out for the whole day. Who are on for the speaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gilchrist for one, our Member for the Dominion, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, strong man, I believe. He's a Liberal, of Course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Ross, "he's a Grit all right, hide-bound too&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which you are not, I take it," replied Monteith with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Traditionally I am a Conservative," said Ross, "but last election I voted
      Liberal. I don't know how you were but I was keen on Reciprocity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The contrary with me," replied Monteith. "Traditionally I am a Liberal,
      but I voted Conservative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You voted against Reciprocity, you a western man voted against a better
      market for our wheat and stuff, and against cheaper machinery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I knew quite well it would give us a better market for our grain
      here, and it would give us cheaper machinery too, but&mdash;do you really
      care to know why I switched?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing; I'd like awfully to hear if you don't mind. We are not
      discussing politics, you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Well," said Monteith, "two things made me change my party. In the
      first place, to be quite frank, I was afraid of American domination. We
      are a small people yet. Their immense wealth would overwhelm our
      manufacturers and flood our markets with cheap stuff, and with trade
      dominance there would more easily go political dominance. You remember
      Taft's speech? That settled it for me. That was one thing. The other was
      the Navy question. I didn't like Laurier's attitude. I am a Canadian, born
      right here in Alberta, but I am an Imperialist. I am keen about the Empire
      and that sort of thing. I believe that our destiny is with the Empire and
      that with the Empire we shall attain to our best. And since the Empire has
      protected us through all of our history, I believe the time has come when
      we should make our contribution to its defence. We ought to have a fleet,
      and that fleet in time of war should automatically be merged with the
      Imperial Navy. That's how I felt at the last election. This autonomy stuff
      of Laurier's is all right, but it should not interfere with Imperial
      unity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a funny thing," replied Ross. "I take the opposite side on both
      these points. I was born in the Old Country and like most Old Country
      people believe in Free Trade. So I was keen to wipe out all barriers
      between the United States and ourselves in trade. I believe in trading
      wherever you can get the best terms. As for American domination, I have
      not the slightest fear in the world of the Yankees. They might flood our
      markets at first, probably would, but they would certainly bring in
      capital. We need capital badly, you know that. And why should not
      factories be established on this side of the line with American money?
      Pennsylvania does not hurt New York, nor Illinois Dakota. Why then, with
      all trade barriers thrown down, should the United States hurt Canada? And
      then on the other side, we get a market for everything we grow at our
      doors. Reciprocity looked good to me. As for imperilling our Imperial
      connections&mdash;I do not mean to be offensive at all&mdash;of course you
      see what your position amounts to&mdash;that our financial interests would
      swamp our loyalty, that our loyalty is a thing of dollars and cents. My
      idea is that nothing in the world from the outside can ever break the
      bonds that hold Canada to the Empire, and after all, heart bonds are the
      strong bonds. Then in regard to the Navy, I take the other view from you
      also. I believe I am a better Canadian than you, although I am not
      Canadian born. I think there's something awfully fine in Canada's splendid
      independence. She wants to run her own ranch, and by George she will, and
      everything on it. She is going to boss her own job and will allow no one
      else to butt in. I agree with what you say about the Empire. Canada ought
      to have a Navy and quick. She ought to take her share of the burden of
      defence. But I agree here with Laurier. I believe her ships should be
      under her own control. For after all only the Canadian Government has the
      right to speak the word that sends them out to war. Of course, when once
      Canada hands them over to the Imperial Navy, they will fall into line and
      take their orders from the Admiral that commands the fleet. Do you know I
      believe that Laurier is right in sticking out for autonomy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am awfully interested in what you say, and I don't believe we are so
      far apart. It's a thousand pities they did not keep together in the
      Commons. They could easily have worked it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it was a beastly shame," replied Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it rather queer," said Monteith, "and isn't it significant,
      too? Here I am, born in Canada, sticking out against reciprocity and
      anxious to guard our Imperial connection and ready to hand our Navy clean
      over to the Imperial authorities, and on the other hand, there you are,
      born in the Old Country, you don't appear to care a darn about Imperial
      connections. You let that take care of itself, and you stick up for
      Canadian autonomy to the limit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, for one thing," replied Ross, "we ought to get together on the Navy
      business. On the trade question we represent, of course, two schools of
      economics, but we ought not to mix up the flag with our freight. This
      flag-flapping business makes me sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are again," said Monteith. "Here I am, born right here in the
      West, and yet I believe in all the flag-flapping you can bring about and
      right here in this country too. Why, you know how it is with these
      foreigners, Ruthenians, Russians, Germans, Poles. Do you know that in
      large sections of this western country the foreign vote controls the
      election? I believe we ought to take every means to teach them to love the
      flag and shout for it too. Oh, I know you Old Country chaps. You take the
      flag for granted, and despise this flag-raising business. Let me tell you
      something. I went across to Oregon a little while ago and saw something
      that opened my eyes. In a little school in the ranching country in a
      settlement of mixed foreigners&mdash;Swedes, Italians, Germans, Jews&mdash;they
      had a great show they called 'saluting the flag.' Being Scotch you despise
      the whole thing as a lot of rotten slushy sentimentality, and a lot of
      Canadians agree with you. But let me tell you how they got me. I watched
      those kids with their foreign faces, foreign speech&mdash;you ought to
      hear them read&mdash;Great Scott, you'd have to guess at the language.
      Then came this flag-saluting business. A kid with Yiddish written all over
      his face was chosen to carry in the flag, attended by a bodyguard for the
      colours, and believe me they appeared as proud as Punch of the honour.
      They placed the flag in position, sang a hymn, had a prayer, then every
      kid at a signal shot out his right hand toward the flag held aloft by the
      Yiddish colour bearer and pledged himself, heart, and soul, and body, to
      his flag and to his country. The ceremony closed with the singing of the
      national hymn, mighty poor poetry and mighty hard to sing, but do you know
      listening to those kids and watching their foreign faces I found myself
      with tears in my eyes and swallowing like a darn fool. Ever since that day
      I believe in flag-flapping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe you are right," replied Ross. "You know we British folk are so
      fearfully afraid of showing our feelings. We go along like graven images;
      the more really stirred up, the more graven we appear. But suppose we move
      over to the platform where the speechifying is to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the school building a platform had been erected, and before
      the stage, preparations had been made for seating the spectators as far as
      the school benches and chairs from neighbours' houses would go. The
      programme consisted of patriotic songs and choruses with contributions
      from the minstrel company. The main events of the evening, however, were
      to be the addresses, the principal speech being by the local member for
      the Dominion Parliament, Mr. J. H. Gilchrist, who was to be followed by a
      local orator, Mr. Alvin P. Jones, a former resident of the United States,
      but now an enthusiastic, energetic and most successful farmer and business
      man, possessing one of the best appointed ranches in Alberta. The chairman
      was, of course, Reverend Evans Rhye. The parson was a little Welshman, fat
      and fussy and fiery of temper, but his heart was warmly human, and in his
      ministry he manifested a religion of such simplicity and devotion, of such
      complete unselfishness as drew to him the loyal affection of the whole
      community. Even such sturdy Presbyterians as McTavish, the Rosses, Angus
      Frazer and his mother, while holding tenaciously and without compromise to
      their own particular form of doctrine and worship, yielded Mr. Rhye, in
      the absence of a church and minister of their own denomination, a support
      and esteem unsurpassed even among his own folk. Their attitude was
      considered to be stated with sufficient clearness by Angus Frazer in
      McTavish's store one day. "I am not that sure about the doctrine, but he
      has the right kind of religion for me." And McTavish's reply was
      characteristic: "Doctrine! He has as gude as you can expec' frae thae
      Episcopawlian buddies. But he's a Godly man and he aye pays his debts
      whatever," which from McTavish was as high praise as could reasonably be
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience comprised the total population of Wolf Willow and its
      vicinity, as well as visitors from the country within a radius of ten or
      fifteen miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. J. H. Gilchrist, M. P., possessed the initial advantages of Scotch
      parentage and of early Scotch training, and besides these he was a farmer
      and knew the farmer's mind. To these advantages he added those of a course
      of training in Toronto University in the departments of metaphysics and
      economics, and an additional advantage of five years' pedagogical
      experience. He possessed, moreover, the gift of lucid and forceful speech.
      With such equipment small wonder that he was in demand for just such
      occasions as a Dominion Day celebration and in just such a community as
      Wolf Willow. The theme of his address was Canadian Citizenship, Its Duties
      and Its Responsibilities, a theme somewhat worn but possessing the special
      advantage of being removed from the scope of party politics while at the
      same time affording opportunity for the elucidation of the political
      principles of that party which Mr. Gilchrist represented, and above all
      for a fervid patriotic appeal. With Scotch disdain of all that savoured of
      flattery or idle compliment, Mr. Gilchrist plunged at once into the heart
      of his subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, the area of Canada. Forty-six years ago, when Canada became a
      nation, the Dominion possessed an area of 662,148 square miles; to-day her
      area covers 3,729,665 square miles, one-third the total size of the
      British Empire, as large as the continent of Europe without Russia, larger
      by over one hundred thousand square miles than the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear," cried an enthusiastic voice from the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, water and snow," in a rasping voice from old McTavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Water and snow," replied Mr. Gilchrist. "Yes, plenty of water, 125,000
      square miles of it, and a good thing it is too for Canada. Some people
      sniff at water," continued the speaker with a humorous glance at McTavish,
      "but even a Scotchman may with advantage acknowledge the value of a little
      water." The crowd went off into a roar of laughter at the little Scotchman
      who was supposed to be averse to the custom of mixing too much water with
      his drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, Mr. McTavish," continued the speaker, "has all a Scotchman's
      hatred of bounce and brag. I am not indulging in foolish brag, but I
      maintain that no Canadian can rightly prize the worth of his citizenship
      who does not know something of his country, something of the wealth of
      meaning lying behind that word 'Canada,' and I purpose to tell you this
      evening something of some of Canada's big things. I shall speak of them
      with gratitude and with pride, but chiefly with a solemnising sense of
      responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for the 'water and the snow' question: Let me settle that now. Water
      for a great inland continental country like ours is one of its most
      valuable assets for it means three things. First, cheap transportation. We
      have the longest continuous waterway in the world, and with two small
      cuttings Canada can bring ocean-going ships into the very heart of the
      continent. Second, water means climate rainfall, and there need be no fear
      of snow and frost while great bodies of open water lie about. And third,
      water power. Do you know that Canada stands first in the world in its
      water power? It possesses twice the water power of the United States (we
      like to get something in which we can excel our American cousins), and
      lying near the great centres of population too. Let me give you three
      examples. Within easy reach of Vancouver on the west coast there is at
      least 350,000 horse power, of which 75,000 is now in use. Winnipeg, the
      metropolitan centre of Canada, where more than in any place else can be
      heard the heart beat of the Dominion, has 400,000 horse power available,
      of which she now uses 50,000. Toronto lies within reach of the great
      Niagara, whose power no one can estimate, while along the course of the
      mighty St. Lawrence towns and cities lie within touch of water power that
      is beyond all calculation as yet. And do you Alberta people realise that
      right here in your own province the big Bassano Dam made possible by a
      tiny stream taken from the Bow River furnishes irrigation power for over a
      million acres? Perhaps that will do about the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo aye," said McTavish, with profound resignation in his voice. "Ye'll
      dae wi' that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And snow," cried the speaker. "We would not willingly be without our snow
      in Canada. Snow means winter transport, better business, lumbering, and
      above all, wheat. Where you have no snow and frost you cannot get the No.
      1 hard wheat. Don't quarrel with the snow. It is Canada's snow and frost
      that gives her the first place in the world in wheat production. So much
      for the water and the snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      McTavish hitched about uneasily. He wanted to have the speaker get done
      with this part of his theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Canada's area Mr. Gilchrist passed on to deal with Canada's
      resources, warning his audience that the greater part of these resources
      was as yet undeveloped and that he should have to indulge in loud-sounding
      phrases, but he promised them that whatever words he might employ he would
      still be unable to adequately picture to their imagination the magnitude
      of Canada's undeveloped wealth. Then in a perfect torrent he poured forth
      upon the people statistics setting forth Canada's possessions in mines and
      forests, in fisheries, in furs, in agricultural products, and especially
      in wheat. At the word "wheat" he pulled up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wheat," he exclaimed, "the world's great food for men. And Canada holds
      the greatest wheat farm in all the world. Not long ago Jim Hill told the
      Minneapolis millers that three-fourths of the wheat lands on the American
      continent were north of the boundary line and that Canada could feed every
      mouth in Europe. Our wheat crop this year will go nearly 250,000,000
      bushels, and this, remember, without fertilisation and with very poor
      farming, for we Western Canadians are poor farmers. We owe something to
      our American settlers who are teaching us something of the science and art
      of agriculture. Remember, too, that our crop comes from only one-seventh
      of our wheat lands. Had the other six-sevenths been cropped, our wheat
      yield would be over three and a half billion bushels&mdash;just about the
      world's supply. We should never be content till Canada does her full duty
      to the world, till Canada gives to the world all that is in her power to
      give. I make no apology for dwelling at such length upon Canada's extent
      and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now let me speak to you about our privileges and responsibilities as
      citizens of this Dominion. Our possessions and material things will be our
      destruction unless we use them not only for our own good, but for the good
      of the world. And these possessions we can never properly use till we
      learn to prize those other possessions of heart and mind and soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a light touch upon the activities of Canadians, in the development of
      their country in such matters as transportation and manufactures, he
      passed to a consideration of the educational, social, industrial,
      political and religious privileges which Canadian citizens enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are the things," he cried, "that have to do with the nation's soul.
      These are the things that determine the quality of a people and their
      place among the nations, their influence in the world. In the matter of
      education it is the privilege of every child in Canada to receive a sound
      training, not only in the elementary branches of study, but even in higher
      branches as well. In Canada social distinctions are based more upon worth
      than upon wealth, more upon industry and ability than upon blue blood.
      Nowhere in the world is it more profoundly true that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'A man's a man for a' that;
      The rank is but the guinea's stamp;
      The man's the gowd for a' that.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      At this old McTavish surprised the audience and himself by crying out,
      "Hear-r-r, hear-r-r," glancing round defiantly as if daring anyone to take
      up his challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In matters of religion," continued the speaker, "the churches of Canada
      hold a position of commanding influence, not because of any privileges
      accorded them by the State, nor because of any adventitious or
      meretricious aids, but solely because of their ability to minister to the
      social and spiritual needs of the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly the speaker proceeded to touch upon some characteristic features
      of Canadian political institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nowhere in the world," he said, "do the people of a country enjoy a
      greater measure of freedom. We belong to a great world Empire. This
      connection we value and mean to cherish, but our Imperial relations do not
      in the slightest degree infringe upon our liberties. The Government of
      Canada is autonomous. Forty-six years ago the four provinces of Canada
      were united into a single Dominion with representative Government of the
      most complete kind. Canada is a Democracy, and in no Democracy in the
      world does the will of the people find more immediate and more complete
      expression than in our Dominion. With us political liberty is both a
      heritage and an achievement, a heritage from our forefathers who made this
      Empire what it is, and an achievement of our own people led by great and
      wise statesmen. This priceless possession of liberty we shall never
      surrender, for the nation that surrenders its liberty, no matter what
      other possessions it may retain, has lost its soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      The address concluded with an appeal to the people for loyal devotion to
      the daily duties of life in their various relations as members of
      families, members of the community, citizens of the Province and of the
      Dominion. In the applause that followed the conclusion of this address,
      even old McTavish was observed to contribute his share with something
      amounting almost to enthusiasm.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SHADOW OF WAR
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was finally agreed that a part at least of the responsibility for the
      disturbance which marred the harmony of the Dominion Day celebration at
      Wolf Willow upon this occasion must rest on the shoulders of Mr. Alvin P.
      Jones. The impressive presentation by Mr. Gilchrist of Canada's greatness
      and the splendour of her future appeared to stimulate Mr. Jones to unusual
      flights of oratory. Under ordinary circumstances Mr. Jones' oratory was
      characterised by such extraordinary physical vigour, if not violence, and
      by such a fluency of orotund and picturesque speech, that with the
      multitude sound passed for eloquence and platitudes on his lips achieved
      the dignity of profound wisdom. Building upon the foundation laid by the
      previous speaker, Mr. Jones proceeded to extol the grandeur of the
      Dominion, the wonders of her possessions, the nobility of her people, the
      splendour of her institutions, the glory of her future. He himself was not
      by birth a Canadian, but so powerful a spell had the Dominion cast over
      him that he had become a Canadian by adoption. Proud of his American birth
      and citizenship, he was even more proud of his Canadian citizenship. He
      saw before him a large number of American citizens who had come to throw
      in their lot with the Dominion of Canada. He believed they had done a wise
      thing, and that among the most loyal citizens of this Dominion none would
      be found more devoted to the material welfare and the spiritual well-being
      of Canada than those who came from the other side of the line. He saw a
      number of those who were sometimes improperly called foreigners. He said
      "improperly" because whatever their origin, whether Ruthenian, Swede,
      French, German, or whatever their race might be, here they were simply
      Canadians with all the rights of Canadian citizenship assured to them. He
      was glad to see so many of his German friends present. They represent a
      great nation whose achievements in every department of human activity, in
      learning, in industrial enterprise, in commerce, were the envy and
      admiration of the world (excursus here in glorification of the great
      German people): To these, his German fellow citizens, he would say that no
      matter how deep their devotion to the Vaterland (Mr. Jones pronounced it
      with a "v") he knew they would be loyal citizens of Canada. The German
      Empire had its differences and disagreements with Great Britain, the
      American Republic has had the same, and indeed it was possible that there
      were a number present who might not cherish any very passionate regard for
      the wealthy, complaisant, self-contained somewhat slow-going old
      gentleman, John Bull. But here in Canada, we were all Canadians! First,
      last and all the time, Canadians (great applause). Whatever might be said
      of other countries, their wealth, their power, their glory, Canada was
      good enough for him (more applause, followed by a further elaboration of
      Canada's vast resources, etc., etc.). Canada's future was unclouded by the
      political complications and entanglements of the older countries in
      Europe. For one hundred years they had been at peace with the Republic
      south of that imaginary line which delimited the boundaries, but which did
      not divide the hearts of these two peoples (great applause). For his part,
      while he rejoiced in the greatness of the British Empire he believed that
      Canada's first duty was to herself, to the developing here of a strong and
      sturdy national spirit. Canada for Canadians, Canada first, these were the
      motives that had guided his life both in public service and as a private
      citizen (loud applause). In this country there was a place for all, no
      matter from what country they came, a place for the Ruthenian (enumeration
      of the various European and Asiatic states from which potential citizens
      of Canada had come). Let us join hands and hearts in building up a great
      empire where our children, free from old-world entanglements, free to
      develop in our own way our own institutions (eloquent passages on freedom)
      in obedience to laws of our own making, defended by the strong arms and
      brave hearts of our own sons, aided (here the speaker permitted himself a
      smile of gentle humour) by the mighty wing of the American eagle
      (references to the Monroe Doctrine and its protection of Canada's shores)
      we shall abide in peace and security from all aggression and all alarm.
      (Thunderous and continued applause, during which the speaker resumed his
      seat.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It was old McTavish who precipitated the trouble. The old Highlander
      belonged to a family that boasted a long line of fighting forbears. Ever
      since The Forty-five when the German king for the time occupying the
      English throne astutely diverted the martial spirit of the Scottish clans
      from the business of waging war against his own armies, their chief
      occupation, to that of fighting his continental foes, The McTavish was to
      be found ever in the foremost ranks of British men-of-war, joyously doing
      battle for his clan and for his king, who, if the truth were told, he
      regarded with scant loyalty. Like so many of the old timers in western
      Canada, this particular McTavish had been at one time a servant of the
      Hudson Bay Company and as such had done his part in the occupation,
      peaceful and otherwise, of the vast territories administered by that great
      trading company. In his fiery fighting soul there burned a passionate
      loyalty to the name and fame of the land of his birth, and a passionate
      pride in the Empire under whose flag the Company's ships had safely sailed
      the northern seas and had safely traded in these vast wild lands for
      nearly three hundred years. Deep as this loyalty and pride in the soul of
      him there lay a cold suspicion of the Yankee. He had met him in those old
      days of trade war, had suffered and had seen his Company suffer from his
      wiles, and finally had been compelled to witness with bitter but
      unavailing hate the steady encroachment of those rival traders upon the
      ancient prerogatives and preserves of his own Company, once the sole and
      undisputed lords of the northern half of the American continent. In the
      person of Mr. Alvin P. Jones, McTavish saw the representative of those
      ancient enemies of his, and in the oration to which he had just listened
      he fancied he detected a note of disloyalty to the flag, a suggestion of a
      break in the allegiance of Canada to the Empire, and worst of all, a hint
      that Canada might safely depend for protection upon something other than
      the naval power which had guarded the shores of his country these many
      years from enemy invasion. These things wrought in old McTavish an
      uncontrollable anger, and no sooner had the tumultuous applause died away
      than he was on his feet and in a high, rasping voice demanding audience.

    <p>
      "Will ye per-r-rmit me, Mr. Chair-r-rman, a few words in regar-r-d to the
      remarkable address to which we haf listened?" Permission was graciously
      granted by the chairman, surprise and complaisant delight mantling the
      steaming face of Mr. Alvin P. Jones, albeit at his heart there lurked a
      certain uneasiness, for on more than one occasion had he suffered under
      the merciless heckling of the little Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a wonderful address we haf been hearing, an eloquent address. Some
      of it iss true an' some of it iss lies [commotion in the audience&mdash;the
      smile on Mr. Alvin P. Jones's face slightly less expansive]. The speaker
      has told us about Canada, its great extent, its vast r-r-resources. Some
      of us haf known about these things while yet his mother was still sucking
      him [snickers of delight from the younger members of the audience and
      cries of, 'Go to it, Mack]. 'Tis a great Dominion whatefer and will be a
      gr-r-reater Dominion yet so lang as it keeps to right ways. He has told us
      of the mighty achievements of Cher-r-rmany. I will jist be askin' him what
      has Cher-r-rmany done for this country or for any country but her ainsel?
      She has cluttered us up wi' pot-metal, cutlery an' such things, an' cheap
      cloth that ye can put yer finger through, an' that will be done in a
      month's wear-r-ring. Musick, ye'll be sayin'! Musick! I was in Calgary not
      long since. They took me to what they will be callin' a music-kale
      [delighted roars of laughter from the audience]. A music-kale indeed! I
      haf hear-r-rd of cauld kale an' het kale, of kale porridge an' kale brose,
      but nefer haf I hear-r-rd before of a music-kale. Bless me, man, I cud
      make neither head nor tail o' it, and they wer-r-re no better themsel's.
      They had printed notes about it an' a bit man makin' a speech about it,
      but not one of them knew a thing about the hale hypotheck. Musick, quare
      musick I call it! If it is musick yer wantin', gif me Angus there wi' the
      pipes [wild cheers testifying to Angus's popularity] or the master-r-r
      himsel' an' the young lady here [this with a courteous bow to Miss
      Switzer] wi' their feeddles. That's what I will be callin' musick. An'
      lairnin'! Lairnin' that will lay sacraleegious hands upon the Sacred Word,
      an' tear-r-r it to bits. That like thing the Cher-r-rman lairnin' is
      doin', and ye can ask Mr. Rhye yonder. An' other things the Cher-r-rmans
      are doin' that keep us all from restin' quiet in our beds. Let them come
      her-r-re to us if they will. Let them come from all the countries of the
      ear-r-rth. We will share wi' them what we haf, provided they will be
      behavin' themsel's and mindin' their peeziness. But this man is sayin'
      somethin' more. He is tellin' us how safe we are, an' that the great
      Republic south o' us will be guar-r-rdin' us frae our enemies. I doubt it
      will be the fox guar-r-rdin' the chicken frae the weasel. Now I'll ask
      this gentleman what it is that has guar-r-rded these shores for the past
      two hundred and fifty year-r-rs? I will tell him&mdash;the Br-r-ritish
      Navy. What has kept the peace of Europe once an' again? The Br-r-ritish
      Navy. Aye, what has protected America not once or twice frae her enemies?
      The Br-r-ritish Navy, an' that same Br-r-ritish Navy is gude enough fer
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumultuous din that followed the conclusion of the cantankerous little
      Highlander's speech was beyond all words, but before the chairman could
      get to his feet, through the uproar a voice strident with passion was
      demanding a hearing. "Mr. Ernest Switzer has the floor," said the
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man's face was white and his voice shaking when he began. "Mr.
      Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I stand here to claim the fair play that
      you say is British for myself and for my race. I am a Canadian citizen. I
      was born in America, but my blood is German. As a Canadian citizen, as an
      American by birth, as a German by blood, I have been insulted to-night,
      and I demand the right to reply to the man who has insulted me. There are
      Canadians here to guard their own honour; the Americans can be trusted to
      protect themselves. Germany is not here to refute the slanders uttered
      against her, but I claim the honour to speak for that great nation, for
      she is a great nation. There is none greater. There is none so great in
      the world to-day." The young man's voice rang out with passionate
      conviction, his pale set face, his blue eyes flaming with rage proclaimed
      the intensity of his emotion. Before his flaming passion the audience was
      subdued into a silence tense and profound. "What has Germany done for the
      world? this man asks. I would like to ask in reply where he has lived for
      the last twenty-five years, and if during those years he has read anything
      beyond his local newspaper? What has Germany done for the world? Germany
      has shown the way to the world, even to America, in every activity of
      life, in industrial organisation, in scientific inquiry in the laboratory
      and in the practical application of science to every-day life. Where do
      your philosophers go for their training? To German universities where they
      seek to understand the philosophy of the immortal Emanuel Kant. Where in
      the world has social reform reached its highest achievement? In Germany.
      Where do you go for your models for municipal government? To Germany.
      Mention any department of human enterprise to-day and in that department
      Germany stands easily in the lead. This man asks what has kept Europe at
      peace all these years, and suggests the British Navy, the one constant
      menace to the peace of Europe and to the freedom of the seas. No, if you
      ask who has kept the peace of Europe I will tell you. The German Kaiser,
      Wilhelm II. To him and to the Empire of which he is the glorious head
      Europe owes its peace and the world its greatest blessings to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Switzer sat down a half a dozen men were on their feet demanding to
      be heard. Above the din a quiet, but penetrating voice was distinguished.
      "Mr. Romayne has the floor," said the Reverend Mr. Rhye, who himself was
      tingling with desire for utterance. Mr. Romayne's appearance and voice
      suggested the boredom of one who felt the whole thing to be rather a
      nuisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies and Gentlemen," he began, "I must apologise for venturing to speak
      at all, having so recently come to this country, though I am glad to say
      that I have been received with such cordial kindness that I do not feel
      myself a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're all right, Jack," cried a voice. "You're right at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at home," said Jack, "and that is one thing that makes me able to
      speak. Few of you can understand the feeling that comes to one who,
      travelling six thousand miles away from the heart of the Empire, finds
      himself still among his own folk and under the same old flag. Nor can I
      express the immense satisfaction and pride that come to me when I find
      here in this new world a virile young nation offering a welcome to men of
      all nationalities, an equal opportunity to make home and fortune for
      themselves, and find also these various nationalities uniting in the one
      purpose of building solid and secure an outpost of the Empire to which we
      all belong. I rise chiefly to say two things. The first is that if Germany
      continues in her present mind she will be at war with our country within a
      very short time. The young man who has just sat down assures us that
      Germany is a great country. Let us at once frankly grant this fact, for
      indeed it is a fact. Whether she is as wonderful or as great as she thinks
      herself to be may be doubted. But it is of importance to know that the
      opinion stated here to-night is the opinion held by the whole body of the
      German people from the Kaiser to the lowest peasant in the Empire. The
      universal conviction throughout that Empire is that not only is Germany
      the greatest nation on earth, but that it has a divine mission to confer
      her own peculiar quality of civilisation upon the other nations of Europe,
      and indeed upon the whole world. We might not quarrel with Germany for
      cherishing this pleasing opinion in regard to herself, but when this
      opinion is wrought into a purpose to dominate the whole world in order
      that this mission might be accomplished the thing takes on a somewhat
      serious aspect. Let me repeat, Germany is a great nation, marvellously
      organised in every department of her life, agricultural, manufacturing,
      educational, commercial. But to what intent? What is the purpose
      dominating this marvellous organisation? The purpose, Ladies and
      Gentlemen, is war. The supreme industry of the German nation is the
      manufacturing of a mighty war machine. I challenge the gentleman who has
      just spoken to deny either of these statements, that Germany believes that
      she has a definite mission to lift up the other nations of Europe to her
      own high level and that to fulfil this mission it is necessary that she be
      in a position of control." The speaker paused for a moment or two. "He
      cannot deny these because he knows they are true. The second thing I wish
      to say is that the Kaiser means war and is waiting only for the favourable
      moment. I believe it is correct to say that for many years after his
      accession to the throne he used his influence on the side of peace, but I
      have every reason to believe that for some years past he has cherished
      another purpose, the purpose of war."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Switzer sprang to his feet and cried, "I challenge the truth
      of that statement. Modern European history proves it to be false, and
      again and again the Kaiser has prevented war. So much is this the case
      that the trustees of the only European fund that recognises distinguished
      service in the interests of peace bestowed upon the Kaiser the Nobel
      Prize."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is quite true," replied Mr. Romayne. "But let me recall to this
      young man's mind a few facts. In 1875 Bismarck was determined to make war
      upon France. He was prevented by the united action of England and Russia.
      Germany made the same attempt in '87 and '91. In 1905 so definite was the
      threat of war that France avoided it only by dismissing her war minister,
      Delcasse. Perhaps my young friend remembers the Casablanca incident in
      1908 where again the Kaiser threatened France with war. Indeed, for the
      last twenty years, even while he was doubtless anxious to maintain peace,
      he has been rattling his sword in his scabbard and threatening war against
      the various nations of Europe. In most of these cases even when he wanted
      peace he bluffed with threats of war. Then came the Agadir incident in
      1911 when once more the Kaiser bluffed. But Great Britain called his bluff
      that time and the great War Lord had to back down with great loss of
      prestige not only with his own people but with the whole of Europe. It
      hurt the Kaiser to think that any nation in Europe should move in any
      direction without his consent. Agadir taught him that he must quit
      bluffing or make up his mind to fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Switzer was upon his feet. "This is a slanderous falsehood," he
      cried. "How does this man know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I happened to be there," was the quiet reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do we know?" again cried Switzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you kindly repeat that remark?" said Mr. Romayne quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe this statement," shouted Switzer, "to be a slanderous
      falsehood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you accuse me of falsehood," said Romayne even more quietly, "that is
      a matter of which we shall not discuss here, but later. But these
      statements that I have made are history. All Germany knows, all Europe
      knows, that at Agadir the Kaiser backed down. He was not ready to fight,
      and he lost prestige by it. When Italy, one of the Triple Alliance, went
      to war against Turkey without consulting him, this lowered still further
      German prestige. In the late Balkan War Germany was again humiliated. She
      backed the wrong horse. Her protege and pupil in war, Turkey, was
      absolutely beaten. These things convince me that Germany knows that her
      hope of dominating Europe is rapidly waning, and she believes that this
      hope can only be realised by war and, therefore, I repeat that the Kaiser
      and his people are only waiting a favourable moment to launch war upon
      Europe and more particularly upon the British Empire, which, along with
      the great American democracy, stands between her and the realisation of
      her dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The British Empire!" cried Switzer scornfully as Romayne took his seat,
      "the British Empire! at the first stern blow this ramshackle empire will
      fall to pieces. Then Great Britain will be forced to surrender her robber
      hold upon these great free states which she has stolen and which she now
      keeps in chains." (Cries of "Never!" "Rot!" "Shut your trap!") Switzer
      sprang to his feet and, shaking his fist in their faces, cried: "I know
      what I am saying. This you will see before many months have passed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Romayne rose to his feet and waited till a silence fell upon the
      audience. "Ladies and Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "this German officer
      knows what he is talking about. That Germany within a few months will make
      her supreme attempt to smash the British Empire I believe is certain. I am
      equally certain that the result of that attempt will not be what this
      gentleman anticipates and desires."
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments the silence remained unbroken. Then young Monteith sprang
      to his feet and led the audience in a succession of mad cheers that
      indicated the depth of passion to which they were stirred. After the
      cheering had subsided Larry rose and in a slightly querulous tone and with
      a humorous smile upon his face he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Chairman, don't you think we are becoming unnecessarily serious? And
      are there not certain things on which we all agree? First that we are all
      Canadians, first, last and all the time. Secondly, that we greatly respect
      and admire our American cousins and we desire only better mutual
      acquaintance for our mutual good. Third, that we are loyal to and
      immensely proud of our Empire, and we mean to stick to it. And fourth,
      that Germany is a great country and has done great things for the world.
      As to the historical questions raised, these are not settled by discussion
      but by reliable historic documents. As to the prophecies made, we can
      accept or reject them as we choose. Personally I confess that I am unable
      to get up any real interest in this German war menace. I believe Germany
      has more sense, not to say proper Christian feeling, than to plunge
      herself and the world into war. I move, Mr. Chairman, that we pass to the
      next order of business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear! Hear!" cried some. "Go on with the programme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No!" said others. "Let's have it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Chairman," said Hec Ross, rising to his feet, "this thing is better
      than any silly old programme, let's have it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the chairman, much against his inclination, for he was a fighter,
      ruled otherwise. "The differences that separate us from one another here
      to-night are not differences that can be settled by argument. They are
      differences that are due partly to our history and partly to the ideals
      which we cherish. We shall go on with the programme."
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the people were in no mood for mere amusement. They had been made
      to face for a brief moment the great and stern reality of war. The words
      and more the manner of Jack Romayne had produced a deep sense in their
      minds of the danger of a European conflagration, and the ominous words of
      the young German spoken as from intimate knowledge only served to deepen
      the impression made by Romayne. But the feeling was transitory, and
      speedily the possibility of war was dismissed as unthinkable. The bogey of
      a German war was familiar and therefore losing its power to disturb them.
      So after two or three musical numbers had been given the audience had
      settled back into its normal state of mind which accepted peace as the
      natural and permanent condition for the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainment would have come to a perfectly proper and harmonious
      close had it not been for the unrestrained exuberance of Sam's humorous
      qualities on the one hand and the complete absence of sense of humour in
      Ernest Switzer on the other. The final number on the programme, which was
      to be a series of humorous character sketches, had been left entirely in
      Sam's hands and consisted of a trilogy representing the characteristics as
      popularly conceived of the French Canadian habitant, the humorous Irishman
      and the obese Teuton. Sam's early association with the vaudeville stage
      had given him a certain facility in the use of stage properties and
      theatrical paraphernalia generally, and this combined with a decided gift
      of mimicry enabled him to produce a really humorous if somewhat broadly
      burlesqued reproduction of these characters. In the presentation of his
      sketch Sam had reserved to the close his representation of the obese
      Teuton. The doings of this Teuton, while sending the audience into roars
      of laughter, had quite a different effect upon Switzer, who after a few
      moments of wrathful endurance made toward the rear of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the obese Teuton has appeared upon the stage in a famished
      condition demanding vociferously and plaintively from the world at large
      sausage. But no sausage is available. At this point a stray dog wanders
      upon the stage. With a cry of delight the famished Teuton seizes the
      unfortunate cur and joyously announcing that now sausage he will have,
      forthwith disappears. Immediately from the wings arise agonised canine
      howlings with which mingles the crashing of machinery. Gradually the
      howlings die into choking silence while the crash of the machinery
      proceeds for a few moments longer. Thereupon reappears the Teuton,
      ecstatic and triumphant, bearing with him a huge sausage, which he
      proceeds to devour with mingled lamentations over his departed "hund" and
      raptures over its metamorphosed condition. In the midst of this mingled
      lamentation and rapture is heard in the distance upon a mouth organ band
      the sound of the German national air. The Teuton is startled, drops his
      sausage upon the stage and exclaiming "Der Kronprinz," hastily beats a
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of this august name Switzer disappears from the rear of the
      audience and makes his way to the back of the stage. In the meantime, to
      the accompaniment of organs and drums, appears upon the stage no less a
      personage than "der Kronprinz," to the reproduction of whose features
      Sam's peculiar facial appearance admirably lends itself. From this point
      the action proceeds with increased rapidity. No sooner had "der
      Kronprinz," who is also in a famished condition, appeared upon the stage
      than his eyes light upon the sausage. With a cry of delight he seizes it
      and proceeds ravenously to devour it. But at the first mouthful renewed
      howlings arise. "Der Kronprinz," in a state of intense excitement, drops
      his sausage and begins a wild search in the corners of the stage and in
      the wings for the source of the uproar. The sausage thus abandoned, aided
      by an invisible cord, wabbles off the stage before the eyes of the
      wondering and delighted audience. Thereafter "der Kronprinz" reappears
      with his "hund" under his arm and begins an active and distracted search
      for his precious sausage. Disappointed in his search for the sausage and
      rendered desperate by his famished condition, he seizes the wretched cur
      and begins gnawing at the tail and retires from the scene, accompanied by
      the howls of the unhappy canine and the applauding shouts of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime while Sam is engaged in executing a lightning change from the
      role of "der Kronprinz" to that of the original obese Teuton, Switzer
      beside himself with rage comes upon him at the precise moment when he is
      engaged in tying up his shoe preparatory to making his final entry upon
      the stage. The posture is irresistibly inviting. The next instant the
      astonished audience beholds the extraordinary spectacle of the obese
      Teuton under the impulse of the irate Switzer's boot in rapid flight
      across the stage upon all fours, bearing down with terrific speed upon the
      rear of the unsuspecting chairman who, facing the audience and with a
      genial smile upon his countenance, is engaged in applauding Sam's previous
      performance. Making frantic but futile efforts to recover himself, Sam
      plunges head on with resistless impact full upon the exact spot where the
      legs of the parson effect a junction with the rest of his person and
      carries that gentleman with him clear off the stage and fairly upon the
      top of old McTavish, who at that moment is engaged in conversation with
      little Miss Haight immediately behind him. Immediately there is a terrific
      uproar, in which through the delighted yells of the crowd, the crashing of
      the overturned chairs, and the general confusion could be heard the
      shrieks of the little spinster and weird Scotch oaths from McTavish. After
      the noise had somewhat subsided and when the confusion had been reduced to
      a semblance of order, McTavish was discovered with his hand upon the
      collar of the dazed parson who in turn held the obese Teuton in a firm and
      wrathful grip, at which once more the whole crowd rocked with an unholy
      but uncontrollable joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Larry who saved the situation by appearing upon the stage and
      gravely announcing that this unfortunate catastrophe was due to a sudden
      international upheaval which as usual in such cases had come about in an
      absolutely unexpected manner and as a result of misunderstandings and
      mistakes for which no one could be held responsible. He proposed in the
      name of the audience votes of thanks to those who had laboured so
      diligently to make the Dominion Day celebration so great a success,
      especially to the ladies and gentlemen who had served upon the various
      committees, to the speakers of the evening, to those who had provided the
      entertainment, and last but not least to the chairman who had presided
      with such grace and dignity over the proceedings of the evening. The
      motion was carried with tumultuous applause, and after the singing of "The
      Maple Leaf" and the national anthem, the meeting came to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the entertainment was over Larry and his mother slowly took the
      trail homewards, declining many offers of a lift from their friends in
      cars and carriages. It was the Harvest Moon. Upon the folds of the rolling
      prairie, upon the round tops of the hills, upon the broad valleys, and
      upon the far-away peaks in the west the white light lay thick and soft
      like a mantle. Above the white-mantled world the concave of the sky hung
      blue and deep and pricked out with pale star points. About the world the
      night had thrown her mystic jewelled robes of white and blue, making a
      holy shrine, a very temple of peace for God and man. For some minutes they
      walked together in silence, after they had bidden good-night to the last
      of their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a world it is, Mother!" said Larry, gazing about him at the beauty
      of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but alas, alas, that God's own children should spoil all this glory
      with hatred and strife! This very night in the unhappy Balkan States men
      are killing each other. It is too sad and too terrible to think of. Oh, if
      men would be content only to do justly by each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those people of the Balkan States are semi-barbarians," said Larry, "and
      therefore war between them is to be expected; but I cannot get myself to
      believe in the possibility of war between Christians, civilised nations
      to-day. But, Mother, for the first time in my life, listening to those two
      men, Romayne and Switzer, I had a feeling that war might be possible.
      Switzer seemed so eager for it, and so sure about it, didn't he? And
      Romayne, too, seemed ready to fight. But then I always remember that
      military men and military nations are for ever talking war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is quite true, my dear," said his mother. "I too find it difficult
      to believe that war is possible in spite of what we have heard to-night.
      Our Friends at Home do not believe that war is imminent. They tell me that
      the feeling between Germany and Britain is steadily improving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet two years ago, Mother, in connection with the Agadir incident war
      might have happened any minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," replied his mother, "but every year of peace makes war
      less likely. The Friends are working and praying for a better
      understanding between these nations, and they are very confident that
      these peace delegations that are exchanging visits are doing a great deal
      for peace. Your Uncle Matthew, who has had a great deal to do with them,
      is very hopeful that a few years of peace will carry us past the danger
      point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope so, Mother. I loathe the very thought of war," said Larry.
      "I think I am like you in this. I never did fight, you know; as a boy I
      always got out of it. Do you know, Mother, I think I would be afraid to
      fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," replied his mother. "Fighting is no work for man, but for
      brute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you would not be afraid, Mother. I know you would stand up to
      anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no," cried his mother. "I could stand up to very little. After
      all, it is only God that makes strong to endure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is not quite the question of enduring, it is not the suffering,
      Mother. It is the killing. I don't believe I could kill a man, and yet in
      the Bible they were told to kill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely, Larry, we read our Bible somewhat differently these days.
      Surely we have advanced since the days of Abraham. We do not find our Lord
      and master commanding men to kill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mother, in these present wars should not men defend their women and
      children from such outrages as we read about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When it comes to the question of defending women and children it seems to
      me that the question is changed," said his mother. "As to that I can never
      quite make up my mind, but generally speaking we hold that it is the
      Cross, not the sword, that will save the world from oppression and break
      the tyrant's power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But after all, Mother," replied Larry, "it was not Smithfield that saved
      England's freedom, but Naseby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps both Naseby and Smithfield," said his mother. "I am not very wise
      in these things."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of their house they came upon Nora sitting in the moonlight.
      "Did you meet Ernest and Mr. Romayne?" she inquired. "They've only gone
      five minutes or so. They walked down with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we did not meet them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be tired after the wild excitement of the day, Mother," said
      Nora. "I think you had better go at once to bed. As for me, I am going for
      a swim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's bully; I'm with you," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they were dressed in their bathing suits, and, wrapped up
      in their mackintosh coats, they strolled toward the little lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's sit a few moments and take in this wonderful night," said Nora.
      "Larry, I want to talk to you about what we heard to-night from those two
      men. They made me feel that war was not only possible but near."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It did not impress me in the very least," said Larry. "They talked as
      military men always talk. They've got the war bug. These men have both
      held commissions in their respective armies. Romayne, of course, has seen
      war, and they look at everything from the military point of view."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was speaking there came across the end of the lake the sound of
      voices. Over the water the still air carried the words distinctly to their
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain what?" It was Switzer's voice they heard, loud and truculent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what you meant by the words 'slanderous falsehood' which you used
      to-night," replied a voice which they recognised to be Jack Romayne's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant just what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you mean to impugn my veracity, because&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because if you did I should have to slap your face just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mein Gott! You&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so loud," said Romayne quietly, "unless you prefer an audience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You schlap my face!" cried the German, in his rage losing perfect control
      of his accent. "Ach, if you were only in my country, we could settle this
      in the only way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you will answer my question." Romayne's voice was low and clear
      and very hard. "Did you mean to call me a liar? Yes or no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A liar," replied the German, speaking more quietly. "No, it is not a
      question of veracity. It is a question of historical accuracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not all," exclaimed the German. "My God, that I should have to
      take insult from you! In this country of barbarians there is no way of
      satisfaction except by the beastly, the savage method of fists, but some
      day we will show you schwein of England&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" Romayne's voice came across the water with a sharp ring like the
      tap of a hammer on steel. "You cannot use your hands, I suppose? That
      saves you, but if you say any such words again in regard to England or
      Englishmen, I shall have to punish you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Punish me!" shouted the German. "Gott in Himmel, that I must bear this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are going to fight," said Nora in an awed and horrified voice. "Oh,
      Larry, do go over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He-l-l-o," cried Larry across the water. "That you, Switzer? Who is that
      with you? Come along around here, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence of some moments and then Romayne's voice came quietly
      across the water. "That you, Gwynne? Rather late to come around, I think.
      I am off for home. Well, Switzer, that's all, I think, just now. I'll say
      good-night." There was no reply from Switzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't come then?" called Larry. "Well, goodnight, both of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, good-night," came from both men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think they will fight?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think not. There's Switzer riding off now. What fools they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Jack Romayne is so quiet and gentlemanly," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quiet, yes, and gentlemanly, yes too. But I guess he'd be what Sam calls
      a 'bad actor' in a fight. Oh, these men make me tired who can't have a
      difference of opinion but they must think of fighting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry, I don't understand you a bit," cried Nora. "Of course they
      want to fight when they get full of rage. I would myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you," said Larry. "You are a real Irish terrier. You are like
      father. I am a Quaker, or perhaps there's another word for it. I only hope
      I shall never be called on to prove just what I am. Come on, let's go in."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a half hour they swam leisurely to and fro in the moonlit water. But
      before they parted for the night Nora returned to the subject which they
      had been discussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry, I don't believe you are a coward. I could not believe that of
      you," she said passionately; "I think I would rather die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't believe it then. I hope to God I am not, but then one can
      never tell. I cannot see myself hitting a man on the bare face, and as for
      killing a fellow being, I would much rather die myself. Is that being a
      coward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if that man," breathed Nora hurriedly, for the household were asleep,
      "if that man mad with lust and rage were about to injure your mother or
      your sisters&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Larry, drawing in his breath quickly, "that would be different,
      eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, you dear goose," said his sister, kissing him quickly. "I am
      not afraid for you."

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MEN AND A MINE
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was early in July that Mr. Gwynne met his family with a proposition
      which had been elaborated by Ernest Switzer to form a company for the
      working of Nora's mine. With characteristic energy and thoroughness
      Switzer had studied the proposition from every point of view, and the
      results of his study he had set down in a document which Mr. Gwynne laid
      before his wife and children for consideration. It appeared that the mine
      itself had been investigated by expert friends of Switzer's from the
      Lethbridge and Crows' Nest mines. The reports of these experts were
      favourable to a degree unusual with practical mining men, both as to the
      quality and quantity of coal and as to the cost of operation. The quality
      was assured by the fact that the ranchers in the neighbourhood for years
      had been using the coal in their own homes. In addition to this Switzer
      had secured a report from the Canadian Pacific Railway engineers showing
      that the coal possessed high steaming qualities. And as to quantity, the
      seam could be measured where the creek cut through, showing enough coal in
      sight to promise a sufficient supply to warrant operation for years to
      come. In brief, the report submitted by the young German was that there
      was every ground for believing that a paying mine, possibly a great mine,
      could be developed from the property on Mr. Gwynne's land. In regard to
      the market, there was of course no doubt. Every ton of coal produced could
      be sold at the mine mouth without difficulty. There remained only the
      question of finance to face. This also Switzer had considered, and the
      result of his consideration was before them in a detailed scheme. By this
      scheme a local company was to be organised with a capitalisation of
      $500,000, which would be sufficient to begin with. Of this amount $200,000
      should be assigned to the treasury, the remaining $300,000 disposed of as
      follows: to Mr. Gwynne, as owner of the mine, should be allotted $151,000
      stock, thus giving him control; the remaining $149,000 stock should be
      placed locally. The proposition contained an offer from Switzer to
      organise the company and to place the stock, in consideration for which
      service he asked a block of stock such as the directors should agree upon,
      and further that he should be secretary of the company for a term of five
      years at a salary of $2,000 per annum, which should be a first charge upon
      the returns from the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ernest insists on being secretary?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, naturally. His interests are all here. He insists also that I be
      president."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why, Dad?" enquired Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Gwynne, with a slight laugh, "he frankly says he would
      like to be associated with me in this business. Of course, he said some
      nice things about me which I need not repeat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh pshaw!" exclaimed Nora, patting him on the shoulder, "I thought you
      were a lot smarter man than that. Can't you see why he wants to be
      associated with you? Surely you don't need me to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora dear, hush," said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an imploring look at her sister, Kathleen left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, Mother, I think it is no time to hush. I will tell you, Dad, why
      he wants to be associated with you in this coal mine business. Ernest
      Switzer wants our Kathleen. Mother knows it. We all know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father gazed at her in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely this is quite unwarranted, Nora," he said. "I cannot allow a
      matter of this kind to be dragged into a matter of business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How would it do to take a few days to turn it over in our minds?" said
      his wife. "We must not forget, dear," she continued, a note of grave
      anxiety in her voice, "that if we accept this proposition it will mean a
      complete change in our family life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Family life, Mother," said Mr. Gwynne with some impatience. "You don't
      mean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, my dear," replied the mother, "that we shall no longer be
      ranchers, but shall become coal miners. Let us think it over and perhaps
      you might consult with some of our neighbours, say with Mr. Waring-Gaunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, surely," replied her husband. "Your advice is wise, as always. I
      shall just step over to Mr. Waring-Gaunt's immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mr. Gwynne's departure, the others sat silent for some moments,
      their minds occupied with the question raised so abruptly by Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may as well face it, Mother," said the girl. "Indeed, you must face
      it, and right now. If this Company goes on with Ernest as secretary, it
      means that he will necessarily be thrown into closer relationship with our
      family. This will help his business with Kathleen. This is what he means.
      Do you wish to help it on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother sat silent, her face showing deep distress. "Nora dear," at
      length she said, "this matter is really not in our hands. Surely you can
      see that. I can't discuss it with you." And so saying she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Nora," said Larry severely, "you are not to worry Mother. And
      besides you can't play Providence in this way. You must confess that you
      have a dreadful habit of trying to run things. I believe you would have a
      go at running the universe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run things?" cried Nora. "Why not? There is altogether too much of
      letting things slide in this family. It is all very well to trust to
      Providence. Providence made the trees grow in the woods, but this house
      never would have been here if Mr. Sleighter had not got on to the job. Now
      I am going to ask you a straight question. Do you want Ernest Switzer to
      have Kathleen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he's a decent sort and a clever fellow," began Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Larry, you may as well cut that 'decent sort,' 'clever fellow' stuff
      right out. I want to know your mind. Would you like to see Ernest Switzer
      have Kathleen, or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you?" retorted her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I would not," emphatically said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To tell the truth, ever since that concert night I feel I can't trust
      him. He is different from us. He is no real Canadian. He is a German."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Nora, you amaze me," said Larry. "What supreme nonsense you are
      talking! You have got that stuff of Romayne's into your mind. The war bug
      has bitten you too. For Heaven's sake be reasonable. If you object to
      Ernest because of his race, I am ashamed of you and have no sympathy with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not because of his race," said Nora, "though, Larry, let me tell you he
      hates Britain. I was close to him that night, and hate looked out of his
      eyes. But let that pass. I have seen Ernest with 'his women' as he calls
      them, and, Larry, I can't bear to think of our Kathleen being treated as
      he treats his mother and sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Nora, let us be reasonable. Let us look at this fairly," began
      Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry! stop or I shall be biting the furniture next. When you assume
      that judicial air of yours I want to swear. Answer me. Do you want him to
      marry Kathleen? Yes or no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as I was about to say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry, will you answer yes or no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no, then," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!" cried Nora, rushing at him and shaking him vigorously. "You
      wretch! Why did you keep me in suspense? How I wish that English stick
      would get a move on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "English stick? Whom do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're as stupid as the rest, Larry. Whom should I mean? Jack Romayne, of
      course. There's a man for you. I just wish he'd waggle his finger at me!
      But he won't do things. He just 'glowers' at her, as old McTavish would
      say, with those deep eyes of his, and sets his jaw like a wolf trap, and
      waits. Oh, men are so stupid with women!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" said Larry. "And how exactly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why doesn't he just make her love him, master her, swing her off her
      feet?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like Switzer, eh? The cave man idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no. Surely you see the difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pity my ignorance and elucidate the mystery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mystery? Nonsense. It is quite simple. It is a mere matter of emphasis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see," said Larry, "or at least I don't see. But credit me with the
      earnest and humble desire to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said his sister, "the one&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Switzer. He is mad to possess her for his very own. He would carry her
      off against her will. He'd bully her to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you would like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I. Let him try it on. The other, Romayne, is mad to have her too. He
      would give her his very soul. But he sticks there waiting till she comes
      and flings herself into his arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You prefer that, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that makes me tired!" said Nora in a tone of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I give it up," said Larry hopelessly. "What do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want both. My man must want me more than he wants Heaven itself, and he
      must give me all he has but honour. Such a man would be my slave! And such
      a man&mdash;oh, I'd just love to be bullied by him."
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Larry stood looking into the glowing black eyes, then
      said quietly, "May God send you such a man, little sister, or none at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few weeks the Alberta Coal Mining and Development Company was an
      established fact. Mr. Waring-Gaunt approved of it and showed his
      confidence in the scheme by offering to take a large block of stock and
      persuade his friends to invest as well. He also agreed that it was
      important to the success of the scheme both that Mr. Gwynne should be the
      president of the company and that young Switzer should be its secretary.
      Mr. Gwynne's earnest request that he should become the treasurer of the
      company Mr. Waring-Gaunt felt constrained in the meantime to decline. He
      already had too many irons in the fire. But he was willing to become a
      director and to aid the scheme in any way possible. Before the end of the
      month such was the energy displayed by the new secretary of the company in
      the disposing of the stock it was announced that only a small block of
      about $25,000 remained unsold. A part of this Mr. Waring-Gaunt urged his
      brother-in-law to secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got twenty thousand myself, you know&mdash;looks to me like a sound
      proposition&mdash;think you ought to go in&mdash;what do you say, eh,
      what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; get ten or fifteen thousand for me," said his brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two days Mr. Waring-Gaunt found that the stock had all been
      disposed of. "Energetic chap, that young Switzer,&mdash;got all the stock
      placed&mdash;none left, so he told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you tell him the stock was for me?" enquired Romayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably that accounts for it. He would not be especially anxious to have
      me in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say? Nothing in that, I fancy. But I must see about that,
      what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let it go," said Romayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gwynne was after me again to take the treasurership," said Waring-Gaunt,
      "but I am busy with so many things&mdash;treasurership very hampering&mdash;demands
      close attention&mdash;that sort of thing, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Personally I wish you would take it," said Romayne. "You would be able to
      protect your own money and the investments of your friends. Besides, I
      understand the manager is to be a German, which, with a German secretary,
      is too much German for my idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you don't like Switzer, eh? Natural, I suppose. Don't like him
      myself; bounder sort of chap&mdash;but avoid prejudice, my boy, eh, what?
      German&mdash;that sort of thing&mdash;don't do in this country, eh?
      English, Scotch, Irish, French, Galician, Swede, German&mdash;all sound
      Canadians&mdash;melting pot idea, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am getting that idea, too," said his brother-in-law. "Sybil has been
      rubbing it into me. I believe it is right enough. But apart altogether
      from that, frankly I do not like that chap; I don't trust him. I fancy I
      know a gentleman when I see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, all right, my boy, gentleman idea quite right too&mdash;but
      new country, new standards&mdash;'Old Family' idea played out, don't you
      know. Burke's Peerage not known here&mdash;every mug on its own bottom&mdash;rather
      touchy Canadians are about that sort of thing&mdash;democracy stuff and
      all that you know. Not too bad either, eh, what? for a chap who has got
      the stuff in him&mdash;architect of his fortune&mdash;founder of his own
      family and that sort of thing, don't you know. Not too bad, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite agree," cried Jack, "at least with most of it. But all the same I
      hope you will take the treasurership. Not only will you protect your own
      and your friends' investments, but you will protect the interests of the
      Gwynnes. The father apparently is no business man, the son is to be away;
      anything might happen. I would hate to see them lose out. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother-in-law turned his eyes upon him, gazed at him steadily for a
      few moments, then taking his hand, shook it warmly, exclaiming,
      "Perfectly, old chap, perfectly&mdash;good sort, Gwynne&mdash;good family.
      Girl of the finest&mdash;hope you put it off, old boy. Madame has put me
      on, you know, eh, what? Jolly good thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what the deuce do you mean?" said Romayne angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;don't wish to intrude, don't you know. Fine girl though&mdash;quite
      the finest thing I've seen&mdash;could go anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother-in-law's face flushed fiery red. "Now look here, Tom," he said
      angrily, "don't be an ass. Of course I know what you mean but as the boys
      say here, 'Nothing doing!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? You mean it? Nothing doing? A fine girl like that&mdash;sweet girl&mdash;good
      clean stock&mdash;wonderful mother&mdash;would make a wife any man would
      be proud of&mdash;the real thing, you know, the real thing&mdash;I have
      known her these eight years&mdash;watched her grow up&mdash;rare courage&mdash;pure
      soul. Nothing doing? My God, man, have you eyes?" It was not often that
      Tom Waring-Gaunt allowed himself the luxury of passion, but this seemed to
      him to be an occasion in which he might indulge himself. Romayne stood
      listening to him with his face turned away, looking out of the window.
      "Don't you hear me, Jack?" said Waring-Gaunt. "Do you mean there's nothing
      in it, or have you burned out your heart with those fool women of London
      and Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly his brother-in-law turned to him. "No, Tom, but I almost wish to
      God I had. No, I won't say that; rather do I thank God that I know now
      what it is to love a woman. I am not going to lie to you any longer, old
      chap. To love a sweet, pure woman, sweet and pure as the flowers out
      there, to love her with every bit of my heart, with every fibre of my
      soul, that is the finest thing that can come to a man. I have treated
      women lightly in my time, Tom. I have made them love me, taken what they
      have had to give, and left them without a thought. But if any of them have
      suffered through me, and if they could know what I am getting now, they
      would pity me and say I had got enough to pay me out. To think that I
      should ever hear myself saying that to another man, I who have made love
      to women and laughed at them and laughed at the poor weak devils who fell
      in love with women. Do you get me? I am telling you this and yet I feel no
      shame, no humiliation! Humiliation, great heaven! I am proud to say that I
      love this girl. From the minute I saw her up there in the woods I have
      loved her. I have cursed myself for loving her. I have called myself fool,
      idiot, but I cannot help it. I love her. It is hell to me or heaven, which
      you like. It's both." He was actually trembling, his voice hoarse and
      shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazement, then pity, finally delight, succeeded each other in rapid
      succession across the face of his brother-in-law as he listened. "My dear
      chap, my dear chap," he said when Romayne had finished. "Awfully glad, you
      know&mdash;delighted. But why the howl? The girl is there&mdash;go in and
      get her, by Jove. Why not, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use, I tell you," said Romayne. "That damned German has got her.
      I have seen them together too often. I have seen in her eyes the look that
      women get when they are ready to give themselves body and soul to a man.
      She loves that man. She loves him, I tell you. She has known him for
      years. I have come too late to have a chance. Too late, my God, too late!"
      He pulled himself up with an effort, then with a laugh said, "Do you
      recognise me, Tom? I confess I do not recognise myself. Well, that's out.
      Let it go. That's the last you will get from me. But, Tom, this is more
      than I can stand. I must quit this country, and I want you to make it easy
      for me to go. We'll get up some yarn for Sibyl. You'll help me out, old
      man? God knows I need help in this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot, beastly rot. Give her up to that German heel-clicking bounder&mdash;rather
      not. Buck up, old man&mdash;give the girl a chance anyway&mdash;play the
      game out, eh, what? Oh, by the way, I have made up my mind to take that
      treasurership&mdash;beastly nuisance, eh? Goin'? Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Off with the dogs for a run somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, take the car&mdash;too beastly hot for riding, don't you know. Take
      my car. Or, I say, let's go up to the mine. Must get to know more about
      the beastly old thing, eh, what? We'll take the guns and Sweeper&mdash;we'll
      be sure to see some birds and get the evening shoot coming back. But, last
      word, my boy, give the girl a chance to say no. Think of it, a German,
      good Lord! You go and get the car ready. We'll get Sybil to drive while we
      shoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Waring-Gaunt found his great, warm, simple heart overflowing with
      delight at the tremendous news that had come to him. It was more than his
      nature could bear that he should keep this from his wife. He found her
      immersed in her domestic duties and adamant against his persuasion to
      drive them to the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shoot," she cried, "I'd love to. But, Tom, you forget I am a rancher's
      wife, and you know, or at least you don't know, what that means. Run along
      and play with Jack. Some one must work. No, don't tempt me. I have my
      programme all laid out. I especially prayed this morning for grace to
      resist the lure of the outside this day. 'Get thee behind me&mdash;' What?
      I am listening, but I shouldn't be. What do you say? Tom, it cannot be!"
      She sat down weakly in a convenient chair and listened to her husband
      while he retailed her brother's great secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, my dear, we are going to begin a big campaign&mdash;begin to-day&mdash;take
      the girls off with us for a shoot&mdash;what do you say, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly, Tom. Give me half an hour to get Martha fairly on the
      rails, and I am with you. We'll take those dear girls along. Oh, it is
      perfectly splendid. Now let me go; that will do, you foolish boy. Oh, yes,
      how lovely. Trust me to back you up. What? Don't spoil things. Well, I
      like that. Didn't I land you? That was 'some job,' as dear Nora would say.
      You listen to me, Tom. You had better keep in the background. Finesse is
      not your forte. Better leave these things to me. Hurry up now. Oh, I am so
      excited."
    </p>
    <p>
      Few women can resist an appeal for help from a husband. The acknowledgment
      of the need of help on the part of the dominating partner is in itself the
      most subtle flattery and almost always irresistible. No woman can resist
      the opportunity to join in that most fascinating of all sport&mdash;man-hunting.
      And when the man runs clear into the open wildly seeking not escape from
      but an opening into the net, this only adds a hazard and a consequent zest
      to the sport. Her husband's disclosures had aroused in Sybil Waring-Gaunt
      not so much her sporting instincts, the affair went deeper far than that
      with her. Beyond anything else in life she desired at that time to bring
      together the two beings whom, next to her husband, she loved best in the
      world. From the day that her brother had arrived in the country she had
      desired this, and more or less aggressively had tried to assist Providence
      in the ordering of events. But in Kathleen, with all her affection and all
      her sweet simplicity, there was a certain shy reserve that prevented
      confidences in the matter of her heart affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far has the German got with her? That is what I would like to know,"
      said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt to herself as she hastily prepared for the motor
      ride. "There's no doubt about him. Every one can see how he stands, and he
      has such a masterful way with him that it makes one think that everything
      is settled. If it is there is no chance for Jack, for she is not the
      changing kind." Meantime she would hope for the best and play the game as
      best she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind running into the Gwynnes' as we pass, Tom?" said his wife
      as they settled themselves in the car. "I have a message for Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Righto!" said her husband, throwing his wife a look which she refused
      utterly to notice. "But remember you must not be long. We cannot lose the
      evening shoot, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just a moment will do," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door Nora greeted them. "Oh, you lucky people&mdash;guns and a dog,
      and a day like this," she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along&mdash;lots of room&mdash;take my gun," said Mr. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tempt me, or I shall come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us what is your weakness, Miss Nora," said Jack. "How can we get you
      to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My weakness?" cried the girl eagerly, "you all are, and especially your
      dear Sweeper dog there." She put her arms around the neck of the beautiful
      setter, who was frantically struggling to get out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweeper, lucky dog, eh, Jack, what?" said Mr. Waring-Gaunt, with a warm
      smile of admiration at the wholesome, sun-browned face. "Come along, Miss
      Nora&mdash;back in a short time, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Short time?" said Nora. "Not if I go. Not till we can't see the birds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you come, Nora?" said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "I want to talk to you,
      and we'll drive to-day and let the men shoot. Where is Kathleen? Is she
      busy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Busy? We are all positively overwhelmed with work. But, oh, do go away,
      or I shall certainly run from it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going in to get your mother to send you both out. Have you had a gun
      this fall? I don't believe you have," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not once. Yes, once. I had a chance at a hawk that was paying too much
      attention to our chickens. No, don't go in, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, I beg of
      you. Well, go, then; I have fallen shamelessly. If you can get Kathleen, I
      am on too."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Mrs. Waring-Gaunt returned with Kathleen and her mother.
      "Your mother says, Nora, that she does not need you a bit, and she insists
      on your coming, both of you. So be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mother," cried the girl in great excitement. "You cannot possibly get
      along without us. There's the tea for all those men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Nora, run along. I can do quite well without you. Larry is
      coming in early and he will help. Run along, both of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there isn't room for us all," said Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Room? Heaps," said Mr. Waring-Gaunt. "Climb in here beside me, Miss
      Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it will be great," said Nora. "Can you really get along, Mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said the mother. "You think far too much of yourself. Get your
      hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hat; who wants a hat?" cried the girl, getting in beside Mr.
      Waring-Gaunt. "Oh, this is more than I had ever dreamed, and I feel so
      wicked!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the better, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Kathleen," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "here between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so afraid I shall crowd you," said the girl, her face showing a
      slight flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit, my dear; the seat is quite roomy. There, are you comfortable?
      All right, Tom. Good-bye, Mrs. Gwynne. So good of you to let the girls
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      In high spirits they set off, waving their farewell to the mother who
      stood watching till they had swung out of the lane and on to the main
      trail.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DAY IN SEPTEMBER
    </h3>
    <p>
      A September day in Alberta. There is no other day to be compared to it in
      any other month or in any other land. Other lands have their September
      days, and Alberta has days in other months, but the combination of
      September day in Alberta is sui generis. The foothill country with plain,
      and hill, and valley, and mighty mountain, laced with stream, and river,
      and lake; the over-arching sheet of blue with cloud shapes wandering and
      wistful, the kindly sun pouring its genial sheen of yellow and gold over
      the face of the earth below, purple in the mountains and gold and pearly
      grey, and all swimming in air blown through the mountain gorges and over
      forests of pine, tingling with ozone and reaching the heart and going to
      the head like new wine&mdash;these things go with a September day in
      Alberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      And like new wine the air seemed to Jack Romayne as the Packard like a
      swallow skimmed along the undulating prairie trail, smooth, resilient, of
      all the roads in the world for motor cars the best. For that day at least
      and in that motor car life seemed good to Jack Romayne. Not many such days
      would be his, and he meant to take all it gave regardless of cost. His
      sister's proposal to call at the Gwynnes' house he would have rejected
      could he have found a reasonable excuse. The invitation to the Gwynne
      girls to accompany them on their shoot he resented also, and still more
      deeply he resented the arrangement of the party that set Kathleen next to
      him, a close fit in the back seat of the car. But at the first feeling of
      her warm soft body wedged closely against him, all emotions fled except
      one of pulsating joy. And this, with the air rushing at them from the
      western mountains, wrought in him the reckless resolve to take what the
      gods offered no matter what might follow. As he listened to the chatter
      about him he yielded to the intoxication of his love for this fair slim
      girl pressing soft against his arm and shoulder. He allowed his fancy to
      play with surmises as to what would happen should he turn to her and say,
      "Dear girl, do you know how fair you are, how entrancingly lovely? Do you
      know I am madly in love with you, and that I can hardly refrain from
      putting this arm, against which you so quietly lean your warm soft body,
      about you?" He looked boldly at the red curves of her lips and allowed
      himself to riot in the imagination of how deliciously they would yield to
      his pressed against them. "My God!" he cried aloud, "to think of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies turned their astonished eyes upon him. "What is it, Jack?
      Wait, Tom. Have you lost something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is, I never had it. No, go on, Tom, it cannot be helped now. Go
      on, please do. What a day it is!" he continued. "'What a time we are
      having,' as Miss Nora would say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, what a time!" exclaimed Nora, turning her face toward them. "Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt, I think I must tell you that your husband is making love to
      me so that I am quite losing my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor things," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "How could either of you help it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is it that all the nice men are married?" inquired Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Miss Nora," said Jack in a pained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean&mdash;why&mdash;I'm afraid I can't fix that up, can I?" she said,
      appealing to Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly you can. What you really mean is, why do all married men become
      so nice?" said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, the answer is so obvious. Do you know, I feel wild
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so do I," replied Kathleen, suddenly waking to life. "It is the
      wonderful air, or the motor, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, too," exclaimed Jack Romayne, looking straight at her, "only with me
      it is not the air, nor the motor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then!" said Kathleen with a swift, shy look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The heart knoweth its own bitterness and a stranger intermeddleth not
      with its joy.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the Bible, I know," said Kathleen, "and it really means 'mind your
      own business.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not that exactly," protested Jack, "rather that there are things
      in the heart too deep if not for tears most certainly for words. You can
      guess what I mean, Miss Kathleen," said Jack, trying to get her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said the girl, "there are things that we cannot trust to words,
      no, not for all the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what you are thinking of," replied Jack. "Let me guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, you must not, indeed," she replied quickly. "Look, isn't that the
      mine? What a crowd of people! Do look."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the valley before them they could see a procession of teams and men
      weaving rhythmic figures about what was discovered to be upon a nearer
      view a roadway which was being constructed to cross a little coolee so as
      to give access to the black hole on the hillside beyond which was the coal
      mine. In the noise and bustle of the work the motor came to a stop
      unobserved behind a long wooden structure which Nora diagnosed as the
      "grub shack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your English speech, Mr. Romayne, the dining room of the camp. He is
      certainly a hustler," exclaimed Nora, gazing upon the scene before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" inquired Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ernest Switzer," said Nora, unable to keep the grudge out of her voice.
      "It is only a week since I was up here and during that time he has
      actually made this village, the streets, the sidewalks&mdash;and if that
      is not actually a system of water pipes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some hustler, as you say, Miss Nora, eh, what?" said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful," replied Nora; "he is wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack glanced at the girl beside him. It seemed to him that it needed no
      mind-reader to interpret the look of pride, yes and of love, in the
      wonderful blue-grey eyes. Sick as from a heavy blow he turned away from
      her; the flicker of hope that his brother-in-law's words had kindled in
      his heart died out and left him cold. He was too late; why try to deceive
      himself any longer? The only thing to do was to pull out and leave this
      place where every day brought him intolerable pain. But today he would get
      all he could, to-day he would love her and win such poor scraps as he
      could from her eyes, her smiles, her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glorious view that," he said, touching her arm and sweeping his hand
      toward the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started at his touch, a faint colour coming into her face. "How
      wonderful!" she breathed. "I love them. They bring me my best thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could reply there came from behind the grub shack a torrent of
      abusive speech florid with profane language and other adornment and in a
      voice thick with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's him," said Nora. "Some one is getting it." The satisfaction in her
      voice and look were in sharp contrast to the look of dismay and shame that
      covered the burning face of her sister. From English the voice passed into
      German, apparently no less vigorous or threatening. "That's better," said
      Nora with a wicked glance at Romayne. "You see he is talking to some one
      of his own people. They understand that. There are a lot of Germans from
      the Settlement, Freiberg, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke Switzer emerged from behind the shack, driving before him a
      cringing creature evidently in abject terror of him. "Get back to your
      gang and carry out your orders, or you will get your time." He caught
      sight of the car and stopped abruptly, and, waving his hand imperiously to
      the workman, strode up to the party, followed by a mild-looking man in
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Came to see how you are getting on, Switzer, eh, what?" said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Getting on," he replied in a loud voice, raising his hat in salutation.
      "How can one get on with a lot of stupid fools who cannot carry out
      instructions and dare to substitute their own ideas for commands. They
      need discipline. If I had my way they would get it, too. But in this
      country there is no such thing as discipline." He made no attempt to
      apologise for his outrageous outburst, was probably conscious of no need
      of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is your foreman, I think?" said Nora, who alone of the party seemed
      to be able to deal with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Mr. Steinberg," said Switzer, presenting the spectacled man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too busy to show us anything this afternoon?" said Nora sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, much too busy," said Switzer, gruffly. "I have no time for anything
      but work these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot come along for a little shoot?" she said, innocently. Nora was
      evidently enjoying herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoot!" cried Switzer in a kind of contemptuous fury. "Shoot, with these
      dogs, these cattle, tramping around here when they need some one every
      minute to drive them. Shoot! No, no. I am not a gentleman of leisure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The distress upon Kathleen's face was painfully apparent. Jack was in no
      hurry to bring relief. Like Nora he was enjoying himself as well. It was
      Tom who brought about the diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we must go on, Switzer. Coming over to see you one of these days
      and go over the plant. Treasurer's got to know something about it, eh,
      what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Switzer started and looked at him in surprise. "Treasurer, who? Are you to
      be treasurer of the company? Who says so? Mr. Gwynne did not ask&mdash;did
      not tell me about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sorry&mdash;premature announcement, eh?" said Tom. "Well, good-bye.
      All set."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Packard gave forth sundry growls and snorts and glided away down the
      trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora was much excited. "What's this about the treasurership?" she
      demanded. "Are you really to be treasurer, Mr. Waring-Gaunt? I am awfully
      glad. You know this whole mine was getting terribly Switzery. Isn't he
      awful? He just terrifies me. I know he will undertake to run me one of
      these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then trouble, eh, what?" said Waring-Gaunt, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short run the motor pulled up at a wheat field in which the shocks
      were still standing and which lay contiguous to a poplar bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good chicken country, eh?" said Tom, slipping out of the car quietly.
      "Nora, you come with me. Quiet now. Off to the left, eh, what? You handle
      Sweeper, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll drive the car," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "Go on with Jack, Kathleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Miss Kathleen, you take the gun, and I'll look after the dog.
      Let me have the whistle, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone ten yards from the car when the setter stood rigid on
      point. "Steady, old boy," said Jack. "Move up quickly, Miss Kathleen. Is
      your gun ready? Sure it's off safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said the girl, walking steadily on the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang! Bang! went Nora's gun. Two birds soared safely aloft. Bang! Bang!
      went Kathleen's gun. "Double, by jove! Steady, Sweeper!" Again the dog
      stood on point. Swiftly Jack loaded the gun. "Here you are, Miss Kathleen.
      You will get another," he said. "There are more here." As he spoke a bird
      flew up at his right. Bang! went Kathleen's gun. "Another, good work."
      Bang! went Nora's gun to the left. "Look out, here he comes," cried Jack,
      as Nora's bird came careening across their front. It was a long shot. Once
      more Kathleen fired. The bird tumbled in the air and fell with a thump
      right at their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweeper, released from his point, went bounding joyfully over the stubble.
      Jack rushed up toward the girl, and taking her hand in both of his, shook
      it warmly. "Oh, splendid, partner, splendid, great shooting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it was easy. Sweeper had them fast," said Kathleen. "And that last
      shot was just awfully good luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck! Good Lord! it was anything but luck. It was great shooting.
      Well, come along. Oh, we're going to have a glorious day, aren't we,
      partner?" And catching hold of her arm, he gave her a friendly little
      shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she cried, responding frankly to his mood, "we will. Let's have a
      good day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you learn to shoot?" inquired Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora and I have always carried guns in the season," replied Kathleen,
      "even when we were going to school. You see, Larry hates shooting. We
      loved it and at times were glad to get them&mdash;the birds, I mean. We
      did not do it just for sport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can your sister shoot as well as you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly, I think. She pulls too quickly, you see, but when she steadies
      down she will shoot better than I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a wonder," said Jack enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not a wonder," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till I get the birds back to the car," he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He-l-l-o," cried his sister as he came running. "What, four of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four," he answered. "By jove, she's a wonder, isn't she. She really bowls
      me over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said his sister in a low voice. "She's just a fine girl with a
      steady hand and a quick eye, and," she added as Jack turned away from her,
      "a true heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A true heart," Jack muttered to himself, "and given to that confounded
      bully of a German. If it had been any other man&mdash;but we have got one
      day at least." Resolutely he brushed away the thoughts that maddened him
      as he ran to Kathleen's side. Meantime, Tom and Nora had gone circling
      around toward the left with Sweeper ranging widely before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's beat round this bluff," suggested Kathleen. "They may not have left
      the trees yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they strolled away through the stubble, the girl moving with an
      easy grace that spoke of balanced physical strength, and with an eagerness
      that indicated the keen hunter's spirit. The bluff brought no result.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That bluff promised chickens if ever a bluff did," said Kathleen in a
      disappointed voice. "We'll get them further down, and then again in the
      stubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer-o," cried Jack. "The day is fine and we are having a ripping time,
      at least I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, too," cried the girl. "I love this, the open fields,&mdash;and the
      sport, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And good company," said Jack boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, good company, of course," she said with a quick, friendly glance.
      "And you ARE good company to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Sometimes, you know, you are rather&mdash;I don't know what to say&mdash;but
      queer, as if you did not like&mdash;people, or were carrying some terrible
      secret," she added with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Secret? I am, but not for long. I am going to tell you the secret. Do you
      want to hear it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The note of desperation in his voice startled the girl. "Oh, no," she
      cried hurriedly. "Where have we got to? There are no birds in this open
      prairie here. We must get back to the stubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not interested in my secret, then?" said Jack. "But I am going to
      tell you all the same, Kathleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please don't," she replied in a distressed voice. "We are having such
      a splendid time, and besides we are after birds, aren't we? And there are
      the others," she added, pointing across the stubble field, "and Sweeper is
      on point again. Oh, let's run." She started forward quickly, her foot
      caught in a tangle of vetch vine and she pitched heavily forward. Jack
      sprang to catch her. A shot crashed at their ears. The girl lay prone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, Kathleen, are you hurt?" said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not a bit, but awfully scared," she panted. Then she shrieked,
      "Oh, oh, oh, Jack, you are wounded, you are bleeding!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at his hand. It was dripping blood. "Oh, oh," she moaned,
      covering her face with her hands. Then springing to her feet, she caught
      up his hand in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nothing at all," he said. "I feel nothing. Only a bit of skin.
      See," he cried, lifting his arm up. "There's nothing to it. No broken
      bones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see, Jack&mdash;Mr. Romayne," she said with white lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say 'Jack,'" he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me take off your coat&mdash;Jack, then. I know a little about this. I
      have done something at it in Winnipeg."
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they removed the coat. The shirt sleeve was hanging in a tangled,
      bloody mass from the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awful!" groaned Kathleen. "Sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nonsense, it is not serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Jack, dear," she entreated, clasping her hands about his sound
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say it again," said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack, won't you sit down, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say it again," he commanded sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack, dear, please sit down," she cried in a pitiful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, then lay back reclining on his arm. "Now your knife, Jack,"
      she said, feeling hurriedly through his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here you are," he said, handing her the knife, biting his lips the while
      and fighting back a feeling of faintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly slipping behind him, she whipped off her white petticoat and tore
      it into strips. Then cutting the bloody shirt sleeve, she laid bare the
      arm. The wound was superficial. The shot had torn a wide gash little
      deeper than the skin from wrist to shoulder, with here and there a bite
      into the flesh. Swiftly, deftly, with fingers that never fumbled, she
      bandaged the arm, putting in little pads where the blood seemed to be
      pumping freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fine," said Jack. "You are a brick, Kathleen. I think&mdash;I will&mdash;just
      lie down&mdash;a bit. I feel&mdash;rather rotten." As he spoke he caught
      hold of her arm to steady himself. She caught him in her arms and eased
      him down upon the stubble. With eyes closed and a face that looked like
      death he lay quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack," she cried aloud in her terror. "Don't faint. You must not faint."
    </p>
    <p>
      But white and ghastly he lay unconscious, the blood still welling right
      through the bandages on his wounded arm. She knew that in some way she
      must stop the bleeding. Swiftly she undid the bandages and found a pumping
      artery in the forearm. "What is it that they do?" she said to herself.
      Then she remembered. Making a tourniquet, she applied it to the upper arm.
      Then rolling up a bloody bandage into a pad, she laid it upon the pumping
      artery and bound it firmly down into place. Then flexing the forearm hard
      upon it, she bandaged all securely again. Still the wounded man lay
      unconscious. The girl was terrified. She placed her hand over his heart.
      It was beating but very faintly. In the agony and terror of the moment as
      in a flash of light her heart stood suddenly wide open to her, and the
      thing that for the past months had lain hidden within her deeper than her
      consciousness, a secret joy and pain, leaped strong and full into the
      open, and she knew that this man who lay bleeding and ghastly before her
      was dearer to her than her own life. The sudden rush of this consciousness
      sweeping like a flood over her soul broke down and carried away the
      barrier of her maidenly reserve. Leaning over him in a passion of
      self-abandonment, she breathed, "Oh, Jack, dear, dear Jack." As he lay
      there white and still, into her love there came a maternal tender yearning
      of pity. She lifted his head in her arm, and murmured brokenly, "Oh, my
      love, my dear love." She kissed him on his white lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the touch of her lips Jack opened his eyes, gazed at her for a moment,
      then with dawning recognition, he said with a faint smile, "Do&mdash;it&mdash;again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you heard," she cried, the red blood flooding face and neck, "but I
      don't care, only don't go off again. You will not, Jack, you must not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I won't," he said. "It's rotten&mdash;of me&mdash;to act&mdash;like
      this and&mdash;scare you&mdash;to death. Give me&mdash;a little&mdash;time.
      I will be&mdash;all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they would only come! If I could only do something!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're all right&mdash;Kathleen. Just be&mdash;patient with me&mdash;a
      bit. I am feeling&mdash;better every minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments he lay quiet. Then with a little smile he looked up at
      her again and said, "I would go off again just to hear you say those words
      once more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please don't," she entreated, hiding her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, Kathleen, I am a beast. Forget it. I am feeling all right. I
      believe I could sit up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no," she cried. "Lie a little longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid his head down, ran a hundred yards to the wheat field, returning
      with two sheeves, and made a support for his head and shoulders. "That is
      better," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good work," he said. "Now I am going to be fit for anything in a few
      moments. But," he added, "you look rather badly, as if you might faint
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? What difference does it make how I look? I am quite right. If they
      would only come! I know what I will do," she cried. "Where are your
      cartridges?" She loaded the gun and fired in quick succession half a dozen
      shots. "I think I see them," she exclaimed, "but I am not sure that they
      heard me." Again she fired several shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about it," said Jack, into whose face the colour was
      beginning to come back. "They are sure to look us up. Just sit down, won't
      you please, beside me here? There, that's good," he continued, taking her
      hand. "Kathleen," he cried, "I think you know my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no, please don't," she implored, withdrawing her hand and hiding
      her face from him. "Please don't be hard on me. I really do not know what
      I am doing and I am feeling dreadfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have reason to feel so, Kathleen. You have been splendidly brave, and
      I give you my word I am not going to worry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you; you are so good, and I love you for it," she cried in a
      passion of gratitude. "You understand, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I do," he said. "By the way, do you know I think I could smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, splendid!" she cried, and, springing up, she searched through his
      coat pockets, found pipe, pouch, matches, and soon he had his pipe going.
      "There, that looks more like living," said Kathleen, laughing somewhat
      hysterically. "Oh, you did frighten me!" Again the red flush came into her
      face and she turned away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There they are coming. Sure enough, they are coming," she cried with a
      sob in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steady, Kathleen," said Jack quietly. "You won't blow up now, will you?
      You have been so splendid! Can you hold on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath, stood for a minute or two in perfect silence, and
      then she said, "I can and I will. I am quite right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they exclaimed and stared and even wept a bit&mdash;at least the
      ladies did&mdash;but Jack's pipe helped out amazingly, and, indeed, he had
      recovered sufficient strength to walk unhelped to the car. And while Tom
      sent the Packard humming along the smooth, resilient road he kept up with
      Nora and his sister a rapid fire of breezy conversation till they reached
      their own door. It was half an hour before Tom could bring the doctor,
      during which time they discussed the accident in all its bearings and from
      every point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad it was not I who was with you," declared Nora. "I cannot stand
      blood, and I certainly should have fainted, and what would you have done
      then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not you," declared Jack. "That sort of thing does not go with your stock.
      God knows what would have happened to me if I had had a silly fool with
      me, for the blood was pumping out all over me. But, thank God, I had a
      woman with a brave heart and clever hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor came, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt went in to assist him, but when
      the ghastly bloody spectacle lay bare to her eyes she found herself grow
      weak and hurried to the kitchen where the others were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am so silly," she said, "but I am afraid I cannot stand the sight
      of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen sprang at once to her feet. "Is there no one there?" she demanded
      with a touch of impatience in her voice, and passed quickly into the room,
      where she stayed while the doctor snipped off the frayed patches of skin
      and flesh and tied up the broken arteries, giving aid with quick fingers
      and steady hands till all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done this sort of thing before, Miss Gwynne?" said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, never," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you certainly are a brick," he said, turning admiring eyes upon
      her. He was a young man and unmarried. "But this is a little too much for
      you." From a decanter which stood on a side table he poured out a little
      spirits. "Drink this," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, Doctor, I am quite right," said Kathleen, quietly picking
      up the bloody debris and dropping them into a basin which she carried into
      the other room. "He is all right now," she said to Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, who
      took the basin from her, exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor dear, you are awfully white. I am ashamed of myself. Now you must
      lie down at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, please, I shall go home, I think. Where is Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora has gone home. You won't lie down a little? Then Tom shall take you
      in the car. You are perfectly splendid. I did not think you had it in
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't, don't," cried the girl, a quick rush of tears coming to her
      eyes. "I must go, I must go. Oh, I feel terrible. I don't know what I have
      done. Let me go home." She almost pushed Mrs. Waring-Gaunt from her and
      went out of the house and found Tom standing by the car smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take her home, Tom," said his wife. "She needs rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, Kathleen; rest&mdash;well, rather. Get in beside me here.
      Feel rather rotten, eh, what? Fine bit of work, good soldier&mdash;no,
      don't talk&mdash;monologue indicated." And monologue it was till he
      delivered her, pale, weary and spent, to her mother.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN EXTRAORDINARY NURSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      "A letter for you, Nora," said Larry, coming just in from the post office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Jane!" cried Nora, tearing open the letter. "Oh, glory," she
      continued. "They are coming. Let's see, written on the ninth, leaving
      to-morrow and arrive at Melville Station on the twelfth. Why, that's
      tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, Nora?" said Larry. "Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jane and her father. She says, 'We mean to stay two or three days,
      if you can have us, on our way to Banff.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah! Good old Jane! What train did you say?" cried Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sixteen-forty-five to-morrow at Melville Station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We'll have one trunk and two boxes, so you will need some sort of rig, I
      am afraid. I hope this will not be too much trouble.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that just like Jane?" said Larry. "I bet you she gives the size of
      the trunk, doesn't she, Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A steamer trunk and pretty heavy, she says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same old girl. Does she give you the colour?" inquired Larry. "Like an
      old maid, she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said Nora, closing up her letter. "Oh, it's splendid. Let's
      see, it is eight years since we saw her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just about fifteen months since I saw her," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And about four months for me," said Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But eight years for me," cried Nora, "and she has never missed writing me
      every week, except once when she had the mumps, and she made her father
      write that week. Now we shall have to take our old democrat to meet her,
      the awful old thing," said Nora in a tone of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane won't mind if it is a hayrack," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but her father. He's such a swell. I hate meeting him with that old
      bone cart. But we can't help it. Oh, I am just nutty over her coming. I
      wonder what she's like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she's the same old Jane," said Larry. "That's one immense
      satisfaction about her. She is always the same, no matter when, how or
      where you meet her. There's never a change in Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if she has improved&mdash;got any prettier, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prettier! What the deuce are you talking about?" said Larry indignantly.
      "Prettier! Like a girl that is! You never think of looks when you see
      Jane. All you see is just Jane and her big blue eyes and her smile.
      Prettier! Who wants her prettier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right, Larry. Don't fuss. She IS plain-looking, you know. But she
      is such a good sort. I must tell Mrs. Waring-Gaunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," said Larry, "and be sure to ask her for her car."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora made a face at him, but ran to the 'phone and in an ecstatic jumble
      of words conveyed the tremendous news to the lady at the other end of the
      wire and to all the ears that might be open along the party line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Mrs. Waring-Gaunt?&mdash;it's Nora speaking. I have the most
      glorious news for you. Jane is coming!&mdash;You don't know Jane? My
      friend, you know, in Winnipeg. You must have often heard me speak of her.&mdash;What?&mdash;Brown.&mdash;No,
      Brown, B-r-o-w-n. And she's coming to-morrow.&mdash;No, her father is with
      her.&mdash;Yes, Dr. Brown of Winnipeg.&mdash;Oh, yes. Isn't it splendid?&mdash;Three
      days only, far too short. And we meet her to-morrow.&mdash;I beg your
      pardon?&mdash;Sixteen-forty-five, she says, and she is always right. Oh, a
      change in the time table is there?&mdash;Yes, I will hold on.&mdash;Sixteen-forty-five,
      I might have known.&mdash;What do you say?&mdash;Oh, could you? Oh, dear
      Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, how perfectly splendid of you! But are you sure you
      can?&mdash;Oh, you are just lovely.&mdash;Yes, she has one trunk, but that
      can come in the democrat. Oh, that is perfectly lovely! Thank you so much.
      Good-bye.&mdash;What? Yes, oh, yes, certainly I must go.&mdash;Will there
      be room for him? I am sure he will love to go. That will make five, you
      know, and they have two bags. Oh, lovely; you are awfully good.&mdash;We
      shall need to start about fifteen o'clock. Good-bye. Oh, how is Mr.
      Romayne?&mdash;Oh, I am so sorry, it is too bad. But, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt,
      you know Dr. Brown is a splendid doctor, the best in Winnipeg, one of the
      best in Canada. He will tell you exactly what to do.&mdash;I beg your
      pardon?&mdash;Yes, she's here. Kathleen, you are wanted. Hurry up, don't
      keep her waiting. Oh, isn't she a dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does she want of me?" said Kathleen, a flush coming to her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and see," said Nora, covering the transmitter with her hand, "and
      don't keep her waiting. What is the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly Kathleen placed the receiver to her ear. "Yes, Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt, it is Kathleen speaking.&mdash;Yes, thank you, quite well.&mdash;Oh,
      I have been quite all right, a little shaken perhaps.&mdash;Yes, isn't it
      splendid? Nora is quite wild, you know. Jane is her dearest friend and she
      has not seen her since we were children, but they have kept up a most
      active correspondence. Of course, I saw a great deal of her last year. She
      is a splendid girl and they were so kind; their house was like a home to
      me. I am sure it is very kind of you to offer to meet them.&mdash;I beg
      your pardon?&mdash;Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. We thought he was doing
      so well. What brought that on?&mdash;Blood-poisoning!&mdash;Oh, Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt, you don't say so? How terrible! Isn't it good that Dr. Brown
      is coming? He will know exactly what is wrong.&mdash;Oh, I am so sorry to
      hear that. Sleeplessness is so trying.&mdash;Yes&mdash;Yes&mdash;Oh, Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt, I am afraid I couldn't do that." Kathleen's face had flushed
      bright crimson. "But I am sure Mother would be so glad to go, and she is a
      perfectly wonderful nurse. She knows just what to do.&mdash;Oh, I am
      afraid not. Wait, please, a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does she want?" asked Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen covered the transmitter with her hand. "She wants me to go and
      sit with Mr. Romayne while she drives you to the station. I cannot, I
      cannot do that. Where is Mother? Oh, Mother, I cannot go to Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt's. I really cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense, Kathleen!" cried Nora impatiently. "Why can't you go,
      pray? Let me speak to her." She took the receiver from her sister's hand.
      "Yes, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, it is Nora.&mdash;I beg your pardon?&mdash;Oh,
      yes, certainly, one of us will be glad to go.&mdash;No, no, certainly not.
      I would not have Mr. Waring-Gaunt leave his work for the world.&mdash;I
      know, I know, awfully slow for him. We had not heard of the change. It is
      too bad.&mdash;Yes, surely one of us will be glad to come. We will fix it
      up some way. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora hung up the receiver and turned fiercely upon her sister. "Now, what
      nonsense is this," she said, "and she being so nice about the car, and
      that poor man suffering there, and we never even heard that he was worse?
      He was doing so splendidly, getting about all right. Blood-poisoning is so
      awful. Why, you remember the Mills boy? He almost lost his arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear Nora," said her mother. "There is no need of imagining such
      terrible things, but I am glad Dr. Brown is to be here. It is quite
      providential. I am sure he will put poor Mr. Romayne right. Kathleen,
      dear," continued the mother, turning to her elder daughter, "I think it
      would be very nice if you would run over to-morrow while Mrs. Waring-Gaunt
      drives to the station. I am sure it is very kind of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it is, Mother dear," said Kathleen. "But don't you think you would
      be so much better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, rubbish!" cried Nora. "If it were not Jane that is coming, I would go
      myself; I would only be too glad to go. He is perfectly splendid, so
      patient, and so jolly too, and Kathleen, you ought to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora, dear, we won't discuss it," said the mother in the tone that the
      family knew meant the end of all conversation. Kathleen hurried away from
      them and took refuge in her own room. Then shutting the door, she began
      pacing the floor, fighting once more the battle which during that last ten
      days she had often fought with herself and of which she was thoroughly
      weary. "Oh," she groaned, wringing her hands, "I cannot do it. I cannot
      look at him." She thought of that calm, impassive face which for the past
      three months this English gentleman had carried in all of his intercourse
      with her, and over against that reserve of his she contrasted her own
      passionate abandonment of herself in that dreadful moment of
      self-revelation. The contrast caused her to writhe in an agony of
      self-loathing. She knew little of men, but instinctively she felt that in
      his sight she had cheapened herself and never could she bear to look at
      him again. She tried to recall those glances of his and those broken,
      passionate words uttered during the moments of his physical suffering that
      seemed to mean something more than friendliness. Against these, however,
      was the constantly recurring picture of a calm cold face and of
      intercourse marked with cool indifference. "Oh, he cannot love me," she
      cried to herself. "I am sure he does not love me, and I just threw myself
      at him." In her march up and down the room she paused before her mirror
      and looked at the face that stared so wildly back at her. Her eyes rested
      on the red line of her mouth. "Oh," she groaned, rubbing vigorously those
      full red lips. "I just kissed him." She paused in the rubbing operation,
      gazed abstractedly into the glass; a tender glow drove the glare from her
      eyes, a delicious softness as from some inner well overflowed her
      countenance, the red blood surged up into her white face; she fled from
      her accusing mirror, buried her burning face in the pillow in an
      exultation of rapture. She dared not put into words the thoughts that
      rioted in her heart. "But I loved it, I loved it; I am glad I did." Lying
      there, she strove to recall in shameless abandon the sensation of those
      ecstatic moments, whispering in passionate self-defiance, "I don't care
      what he thinks. I don't care if I was horrid. I am NOT sorry. Besides, he
      looked so dreadful." But she was too honest not to acknowledge to herself
      that not for pity's sake but for love's she had kissed him, and without
      even his invitation. Then once again she recalled the look in his eyes of
      surprise in the moment of his returning consciousness, and the little
      smile that played around his lips. Again wave upon wave of sickening
      self-loathing flooded from her soul every memory of the bliss of that
      supreme moment. Even now she could feel the bite of the cold, half
      humorous scorn in the eyes that had opened upon her as she withdrew her
      lips from his. On the back of this came another memory, sharp and
      stabbing, that this man was ill, perhaps terribly ill. "We are a little
      anxious about him," his sister had said, and she had mentioned the word
      "blood-poisoning." Of the full meaning of that dread word Kathleen had
      little knowledge, but it held for her a horror of something unspeakably
      dangerous. He had been restless, sleepless, suffering for the last two
      days and two nights. That very night and that very hour he was perhaps
      tossing in fever. An uncontrollable longing came over her to go to him.
      Perhaps she might give him a few hours' rest, might indeed help to give
      him the turn to health again. After all, what mattered her feelings. What
      difference if he should despise her, provided she brought him help in an
      hour of crisis. Physically weary with the long struggle through which she
      had been passing during the last ten days, sick at heart, and torn with
      anxiety for the man she loved, she threw herself upon her bed and
      abandoned herself to a storm of tears. Her mother came announcing tea, but
      this she declined, pleading headache and a desire to sleep. But no sooner
      had her mother withdrawn than she rose from her bed and with deliberate
      purpose sat herself down in front of her mirror again. She would have this
      out with herself now. "Well, you are a beauty, sure enough," she said,
      addressing her swollen and disfigured countenance. "Why can't you behave
      naturally? You are acting like a fool and you are not honest with
      yourself. Come now, tell the truth for a few minutes if you can. Do you
      want to go and see this man or not? Answer truly." "Well, I do then." The
      blue eyes looked back defiantly at her. "Why? to help him? for his sake?
      Come, the truth." "Yes, for his sake, at least partly." "And for your own
      sake, too? Come now, none of that. Never mind the blushing." "Yes, for my
      own sake, too." "Chiefly for your own sake?" "No, I do not think so.
      Chiefly I wish to help him." "Then why not go?" Ah, this is a poser. She
      looks herself fairly in the eye, distinctly puzzled. Why should she not
      simply go to him and help him through a bad hour? With searching,
      deliberate persistence she demanded an answer. She will have the truth out
      of herself. "Why not go to him if you so desire to help him?" "Because I
      am ashamed, because I have made myself cheap, and I cannot bear his eyes
      upon me. Because if I have made a mistake and he does not care for me&mdash;oh,
      then I never want to see him again, for he would pity me, and that I
      cannot bear." "What? Not even to bring him rest and relief from his pain?
      Not to help him in a critical hour? He has been asking for you, remember."
      Steadily they face each other, eye to eye, and all at once she is
      conscious that the struggle is over, and, looking at the face in the
      glass, she says, "Yes, I think I would be willing to do that for him, no
      matter how it would shame me." Another heart-searching pause, and the eyes
      answer her again, "I will go to-morrow." At once she reads a new peace in
      the face that gazes at her so weary and wan, and she knows that for the
      sake of the man she loves she is willing to endure even the shame of his
      pity. The battle was over and some sort of victory at least she had won.
      An eager impatience possessed her to go to him at once. "I wish it were
      to-morrow now, this very minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and looked out into the night. There was neither moon nor stars
      and a storm was brewing, but she knew she could find her way in the dark.
      Quietly and with a great peace in her heart she bathed her swollen face,
      changed her dress to one fresh from the ironing board&mdash;pale blue it
      was with a dainty vine running through it&mdash;threw a wrap about her and
      went out to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going up to the Waring-Gaunts', Mother. They might need me," she
      said in a voice of such serene control that her mother only answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, Larry will go with you. He will soon be in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need, Mother, I am not afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother made no answer but came to her and with a display of tenderness
      unusual between them put her arms about her and kissed her. "Good-night,
      then, darling; I am sure you will do them good."
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was gusty and black, but Kathleen had no fear. The road was
      known to her, and under the impulse of the purpose that possessed her she
      made nothing of the darkness nor of the approaching storm. She hurried
      down the lane toward the main trail, refusing to discuss with herself the
      possible consequence of what she was doing. Nor did she know just what
      situation she might find at the Waring-Gaunts'. They would doubtless be
      surprised to see her. They might not need her help at all. She might be
      going upon a fool's errand, but all these suppositions and forebodings she
      brushed aside. She was bent upon an errand of simple kindness and help. If
      she found she was not needed she could return home and no harm done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving no response to her knock, she went quietly into the living room.
      A lamp burned low upon the table. There was no one to be seen. Upstairs a
      child was wailing and the mother's voice could be heard soothing the
      little one to sleep. From a bedroom, of which the door stood open, a voice
      called. The girl's heart stood still. It was Jack's voice, and he was
      calling for his sister. She ran upstairs to the children's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is calling for you," she said to Mrs. Waring-Gaunt without preliminary
      greeting. "Let me take Doris."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Doris set up a wail of such acute dismay that the distracted mother
      said, "Could you just step in and see what is wanted? Jack has been in bed
      for two days. We have been unable to get a nurse anywhere, and tonight
      both little girls are ill. I am so thankful you came over. Indeed, I was
      about to send for one of you. Just run down and see what Jack wants. I
      hope you don't mind. I shall be down presently when Doris goes to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going to sleep, Mamma," answered Doris emphatically. "I am going
      to keep awake, for if I go to sleep I know you will go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, darling, Mother is going to stay with you," and she took the
      little one in her arms, adding, "Now we are all right, aren't we."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen ran downstairs, turned up the light in the living room and passed
      quietly into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to trouble you, Sybil, but there's something wrong with this
      infernal bandage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen went and brought in the lamp. "Your sister cannot leave Doris,
      Mr. Romayne," she said quietly. "Perhaps I can be of use."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments the sick man gazed at her as at a vision. "Is this
      another of them?" he said wearily. "I have been having hallucinations of
      various sorts for the last two days, but you do look real. It is you,
      Kathleen, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really me, Mr. Romayne," said the girl cheerfully. "Let me look at your
      arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hang it, say 'Jack,' won't you, and be decent to a fellow. My God, I
      have wanted you for these ten days. Why didn't you come to me? What did I
      do? I hurt you somehow, but you know I wouldn't willingly. Why have you
      stayed away from me?" He raised himself upon his elbow, his voice was
      high, thin, weak, his eyes glittering, his cheeks ghastly with the high
      lights of fever upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shocked, startled and filled with a poignant mothering pity, Kathleen
      struggled with a longing to take him in her arms and comfort him as the
      mother was the little wailing child upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me just a moment," she cried, and ran out into the living room and
      then outside the door and stood for a moment in the dark, drawing deep
      breaths and struggling to get control of the pity and of the joy that
      surged through her heart. "Oh, God," she cried, lifting her hands high
      above her head in appeal, "help me to be strong and steady. He needs me
      and he wants me too."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the darkness in answer to her appeal there came a sudden quietness of
      nerve and a sense of strength and fitness for her work. Quickly she
      entered the house and went again to the sick room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God," cried Jack. "I thought I was fooled again. You won't go away,
      Kathleen, for a little while, will you? I feel just like a kiddie in the
      dark, do you know? Like a fool rather. You won't go again?" He raised
      himself upon his arm, the weak voice raised to a pitiful appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took all her own fortitude to keep her own voice steady. "No, Jack, I
      am going to stay. I am your nurse, you know, and I am your boss too. You
      must do just as I say. Remember that. You must behave yourself as a sick
      man should."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank back quietly upon the pillow. "Thank God. Anything under heaven I
      promise if only you stay, Kathleen. You will stay, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you hear me promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," he said, a great relief in his tired face. "All right, I am
      good. But you have made me suffer, Kathleen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, no talk," said Kathleen. "We will look at that arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She loosened the bandages. The inflamed and swollen appearance of the arm
      sickened and alarmed her. There was nothing she could do there. She
      replaced the bandages. "You are awfully hot. I am going to sponge your
      face a bit if you will let me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," he said gratefully, "do anything you like if only you don't go
      away again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, none of that. A nurse doesn't run away from her job, does she?" She
      had gotten control of herself, and her quick, clever fingers, with their
      firm, cool touch, seemed to bring rest to the jangling nerves of the sick
      man. Whatever it was, whether the touch of her fingers or the relief of
      the cool water upon his fevered face and arm, by the time the bathing
      process was over, Jack was lying quietly, already rested and looking like
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, this is heavenly," he murmured. "Now a drink, if you please. I
      believe there is medicine about due too," he said. She gave him a drink,
      lifting up his head on her strong arm. "I could lift myself, you know," he
      said, looking up into her face with a little smile, "but I like this way
      so much better if you don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not; I am your nurse, you know," replied Kathleen. "Now your
      medicine." She found the bottle under his direction and, again lifting his
      head, gave him his medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, this is fine. I will take my medicine as often as you want me to, and
      I think another drink would be good." She brought him the glass. "I like
      to drink slowly," he said, looking up into her eyes. But she shook her
      head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No nonsense now," she warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" he said, sinking back with a sigh, "I want you to believe me,
      Kathleen, it is anything but nonsense. My God, it is religion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," said Kathleen, ignoring his words, "I shall just smooth out
      your pillows and straighten down your bed, tuck you in and make you
      comfortable for the night and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then," he interrupted eagerly, "oh, Kathleen, all good children get
      it, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep flush tinged her face. "Now you are not behaving properly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Kathleen," he cried, "why not? Listen to me. There's no use. I
      cannot let you go till I have this settled. I must know. No, don't pull
      away from me, Kathleen. You know I love you, with all my soul, with all I
      have, I love you. Oh, don't pull away from me. Ever since that day when I
      first saw you three months ago I have loved you. I have tried not to. God
      knows I have tried not to because I thought you were pledged to that&mdash;that
      German fellow. Tell me, Kathleen. Why you are shaking, darling! Am I
      frightening you? I would not frighten you. I would not take advantage of
      you. But do you care a little bit? Tell me. I have had ten days of sheer
      hell. For one brief minute I thought you loved me. You almost said you
      did. But then you never came to me and I have feared that you did not
      care. But to-night I must know. I must know now." He raised himself up to
      a sitting posture. "Tell me, Kathleen; I must know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack," she panted. "You are not yourself now. You are weak and just
      imagine things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Imagine things," he cried with a kind of fierce rage. "Imagine! Haven't I
      for these three months fought against this every day? Oh, Kathleen, if you
      only knew. Do you love me a little, even a little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the girl ceased her struggling. "A little!" she cried. "No, Jack,
      not a little, but with all my heart I love you. I should not tell you
      to-night, and, oh, I meant to be so strong and not let you speak till you
      were well again, but I can't help it. But are you quite sure, Jack? Are
      you sure you won't regret this when you are well again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his strong arm round about her and drew her close. "I can't half
      hold you, darling," he said in her ear. "This confounded arm of mine&mdash;but
      you do it for me. Put your arms around me, sweetheart, and tell me that
      you love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wreathed her arms round about his neck and drew him close. "Oh, Jack,"
      she said, "I may be wrong, but I am so happy, and I never thought to be
      happy again. I cannot believe it. Oh, what awful days these have been!"
      she said with a break in her voice and hiding her face upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, sweetheart, think of all the days before us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure, Jack?" she whispered to him, still hiding her face. "Are
      you very sure that you will not be ashamed of me? I felt so dreadful and I
      came in just to help you, and I was so sure of myself. But when I saw you
      lying there, Jack, I just could not help myself." Her voice broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned her face up a little toward him. "Look at me," he said. She
      opened her eyes and, looking steadily into his, held them there. "Say,
      'Jack, I love you,'" he whispered to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great flood of red blood rushed over her face, then faded, leaving her
      white, but still her eyes held his fast. "Jack," she whispered, "my Jack,
      I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kathleen, dear heart," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closer he drew her lips toward his. Suddenly she closed her eyes, her
      whole body relaxed, and lay limp against him. As his lips met hers, her
      arms tightened about him and held him in a strong embrace. Then she opened
      her eyes, raised herself up, and gazed at him as if in surprise. "Oh,
      Jack," she cried, "I cannot think it is true. Are you sure? I could not
      bear it if you were mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a footstep on the stair. "Let me go, Jack; there's
      your sister coming. Quick! Lie down." Hurriedly, she began once more to
      bathe his face as Mrs. Waring-Gaunt came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he resting?" she said. "Why, Jack, you seem quite feverish. Did you
      give him his medicine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, about an hour ago, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hour! Why, before you came upstairs? How long have you been in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, immediately after I came down," said the girl in confusion. "I
      don't know how long ago. I didn't look at the time." She busied herself
      straightening the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sybil, she doesn't know how long ago," said Jack. "She's been behaving as
      I never have heard of any properly trained nurse behaving. She's been
      kissing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack," gasped Kathleen, flushing furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kissing you!" exclaimed Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, looking from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and I have been kissing her," continued Jack shamelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jack," again gasped Kathleen, looking at Mrs. Waring-Gaunt
      beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued Jack in a voice of triumph, "and we are going to do it
      right along every day and all day long with suitable pauses for other
      duties and pleasures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you darling," exclaimed Mrs. Waring-Gaunt rushing at her. "I am so
      glad. Well, you are a 'wunner' as the Marchioness says. I had thought&mdash;but
      never mind. Jack, dear, I do congratulate you. I think you are in awful
      luck. Yes, and you too, Kathleen, for he is a fine boy. I will go and tell
      Tom this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," said Jack, "and please don't hurry. My nurse is perfectly competent
      to take care of me in the meantime."

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COMING OF JANE
    </h3>
    <p>
      At sixteen-forty-five the Waring-Gaunt car was standing at the Melville
      Station awaiting the arrival of the train which was to bring Jane and her
      father, but no train was in sight. Larry, after inquiry at the wicket,
      announced that she was an hour late. How much more the agent, after the
      exasperating habit of railroad officials, could not say, nor could he
      assign any reason for the delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me talk to him," said Nora impatiently. "I know Mr. Field."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently the official reserve in which Mr. Field had wrapped himself was
      not proof against the smile which Nora flung at him through the wicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We really cannot say how late she will be, Miss Nora. I may tell you, but
      we are not saying anything about it, that there has been an accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An accident!" exclaimed Nora. "Why, we are expecting&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, there is no one hurt. A freight has been derailed, and torn up the
      track a bit. The passenger train is held up just beyond Fairfield. It will
      be a couple of hours, perhaps three, before she arrives." At this point
      the telegraph instrument clicked. "Just a minute, Miss Nora, there may be
      something on the wire." With his fingers on the key he executed some
      mysterious prestidigitations, wrote down some words, and came to the
      wicket again. "Funny," he said, "it is a wire for you, Miss Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora took the yellow slip and read: "Delayed by derailed freight. Time of
      arrival uncertain. Very sorry, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of this?" cried Nora, carrying the telegram out to the
      car. "Isn't it perfectly exasperating? That takes off one of their
      nights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the accident?" inquired Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just above Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairfield! The poor things! Jump in and we will be there in no time. It
      is not much further to Wolf Willow from Fairfield than from here. Hurry
      up, we must make time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, I know your driving. Just remember that I am an
      only son. I prefer using all four wheels on curves, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her go," cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Waring-Gaunt "let her go" at such speed that Larry declared he
      had time for only two perfectly deep breaths, one before they started, the
      other after they had pulled up beside the Pullman car at the scene of the
      wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, Jane, Jane," yelled Larry, waving his hands wildly to a girl who
      was seen sitting beside a window reading. The girl looked up, sprang from
      her seat, and in a moment or two appeared on the platform. "Come on,"
      yelled Larry. He climbed over a wire fence, and up the steep grade of the
      railroad embankment. Down sprang the girl, met him half way up the
      embankment, and gave him both her hands. "Jane, Jane," exclaimed Larry.
      "You are looking splendidly. Do you know," he added in a low voice, "I
      should love to kiss you right here. May I? Look at all the people; they
      would enjoy it so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl jerked away her hands, the blood showing dully under her brown
      skin. "Stop it, you silly boy. Is that Nora? Yes, it is." She waved her
      hand wildly at Nora, who was struggling frantically with the barbed wire
      fence. "Wait, I am coming, Nora," cried Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the embankment she scrambled and, over the wire, the two girls
      embraced each other to the delight of the whole body of the passengers
      gathered at windows and on platforms, and to the especial delight of a
      handsome young giant, resplendent in a new suit of striped flannels,
      negligee shirt, blue socks with tie to match, and wearing a straw hat
      adorned with a band in college colours. With a wide smile upon his face he
      stood gazing down upon the enthusiastic osculation of the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, this is Jane," cried Nora. "Mrs. Waring-Gaunt has come
      to meet you and take you home," she added to Jane. "You know we have no
      car of our own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do," said Jane, smiling at Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "I can't get at
      you very well just now. It was very kind of you to come for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she has left her brother very sick at home," said Nora in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't keep you waiting," said Jane, beginning to scramble up the bank
      again. "Come, Larry, I shall get father and you shall help with our
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Met your friends, I see, Miss Brown," said the handsome giant. "I know it
      is mean of me, but I am really disgusted. It is bad enough to be held up
      here for a night, but to lose your company too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am awfully glad," said Jane, giving him such a delighted smile
      that he shook his head disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need telling me that. Say," he added in an undertone, "that's your
      friend Nora, ain't it? Stunning girl. Introduce me, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if you will help me with my things. I am in an awful hurry and don't
      want to keep them waiting. Larry, this is Mr. Dean Wakeham." The young man
      shook hands with cordial frankness, Larry with suspicion in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me have your check, Jane, and I will go and get your trunk," said
      Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you come with me, Larry," said Jane decidedly. "The trunk is too big
      for you to handle. Mr. Wakeham, you will get it for me, won't you, please?
      I will send a porter to help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gladly, Miss Brown. No, I mean with the deepest pain and regret," said
      Wakeham, going for the trunk while Larry accompanied her in quest of the
      minor impedimenta that constituted her own and her father's baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, have you any idea how glad I am to see you?" demanded Larry as they
      passed into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's radiant smile transformed her face. "Yes, I think so," she said
      simply. "But we must hurry. Oh, here is Papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brown hailed Larry with acclaim. "This is very kind of you, my dear
      boy; you have saved us a tedious wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must hurry, Papa," said Jane, cutting him short. "Mrs. Waring-Gaunt,
      who has come for us in her car, has left her brother ill at home." She
      marshalled them promptly into the car and soon had them in line for the
      motor, bearing the hand baggage and wraps, the porter following with
      Jane's own bag. "Thank you, porter," said Jane, giving him a smile that
      reduced that functionary to the verge of grinning imbecility, and a tip
      which he received with an air of absent-minded indifference. "Good-bye,
      porter; you have made us very comfortable," said Jane, shaking hands with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Miss; it shuah is a pleasuah to wait on a young lady like you,
      Miss. It shuah is, Miss. Ah wish you a prospec jounay, Miss, Ah do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what is keeping Mr. Wakeham," said Jane. "I am very sorry to
      keep you waiting, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. Larry, would you mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Larry, hurrying off toward the baggage car. In a few
      minutes Mr. Wakeham appeared with the doleful news that the trunk was not
      in the car and must have been left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite sure it is there," said Jane, setting off herself for the car,
      the crestfallen Mr. Wakeham and the porter following behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the car the baggage man met her with regretful apologies.
      "The trunk must have been left behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was brusquely informed by Jane that she had seen it put on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it must have been put off by mistake at Calgary?" This suggestion
      was brushed aside as unworthy of consideration. The trunk was here in this
      car, she was sure. This the baggage man and Mr. Wakeham united in
      declaring quite impossible. "We have turned the blasted car upside down,"
      said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible?" exclaimed Jane, who had been exploring the dark recesses of
      the car. "Why, here it is, I knew it was here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah," cried Larry, "we have got it anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wakeham and the baggage man went to work to extricate the trunk from
      the lowest tier of boxes. They were wise enough to attempt no excuse or
      explanation, and in Jane's presence they felt cribbed, cabined and
      confined in the use of such vocabulary as they were wont to consider
      appropriate to the circumstances, and in which they prided themselves as
      being adequately expert. A small triumphal procession convoyed the trunk
      to the motor, Jane leading as was fitting, Larry and Mr. Wakeham forming
      the rear guard. The main body consisted of the porter, together with the
      baggage man, who, under a flagellating sense of his incompetence, was so
      moved from his wonted attitude of haughty indifference as to the fate of a
      piece of baggage committed to his care when once he had contemptuously
      hurled it forth from the open door of his car as to personally aid in
      conducting by the unusual and humiliating process of actually handling
      this particular bit of baggage down a steep and gravelly bank and over a
      wire fence and into a motor car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane's a wonder," confided Larry to Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sure is," said that young man. "You cannot slip anything past her,
      and she's got even that baggage man tamed and tied and ready to catch
      peanuts in his mouth. First time I have seen that done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You just wait till she smiles her farewell at him," said Larry, hugely
      enjoying the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they stood awaiting the occurrence of this phenomenon.
      "Gosh-a-mighty, look at him," murmured Mr. Wakeham. "Takes it like pie.
      He'd just love to carry that blasted trunk up the grade and back to the
      car, if she gave him the wink. Say, she ain't much to look at, but somehow
      she's got me handcuffed and chained to her chariot wheels. Say," he
      continued with a shyness not usual with him, "would you mind introducing
      me to the party?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction, however, was performed by Jane, who apparently
      considered Mr. Wakeham as being under her protection. "Mrs. Waring-Gaunt,
      this is Mr. Wakeham. Mr. Wakeham is from Chicago, but," she hastened to
      add, "he knows some friends of ours in Winnipeg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see I am fairly respectable," said Mr. Wakeham, shaking hand with
      Mrs. Waring-Gaunt and Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the laughter had ceased, Mr. Wakeham said, "If your car were only a
      shade larger I should beg hospitality along with Dr. and Miss Brown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Room on the top," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt with a smile, "but it seems the
      only place left. You are just passing through, Mr. Wakeham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am going on to Manor Mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's only twenty miles down the line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then may I run up to see you?" eagerly asked Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, we shall be delighted to see you," said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count on me, then," said the delighted Mr. Wakeham, lifting his hat in
      farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brown took his place in the front seat beside Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, the
      three young people occupying the seat in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" asked Larry when they had finally got under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend of the James Murrays in Winnipeg. You remember them, don't you?
      Ethel Murray was in your year. He is very nice indeed, don't you think so,
      Papa?" said Jane, appealing to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine young chap," said Dr. Brown with emphasis. "His father is in mines
      in rather a big way, I believe. Lives in Chicago, has large holdings in
      Alberta coal mines about here somewhere, I fancy. The young man is a
      recent graduate from Cornell and is going into his father's business. He
      strikes me as an exceptionally able young fellow." And for at least five
      miles of the way Dr. Brown discussed the antecedents, the character, the
      training, the prospects of the young American till Larry felt qualified to
      pass a reasonably stiff examination on that young man's history, character
      and career.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tell me," said Larry to Jane at the first real opening that offered,
      "what does this talk about a three days' visit to us mean. The idea of
      coming a thousand miles on your first visit to your friends, some of whom
      you have not seen for eight years and staying three days!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see Papa is on his way to Banff," explained Jane, "and then he goes
      to the coast and he only has a short time. So we could plan only for three
      days here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can plan better than that," said Larry confidently, "but never mind
      just now. We shall settle that to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey home was given to the careful recital of news of Winnipeg, of
      the 'Varsity, and of mutual friends. It was like listening to the reading
      of a diary to hear Jane bring up to date the doings and goings and
      happenings in the lives of their mutual friends for the past year. Gossip
      it was, but of such kindly nature as left no unpleasant taste in the mouth
      and gave no unpleasant picture of any living soul it touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, who do you think came to see me two weeks ago? An old friend of
      yours, Hazel Sleighter. Mrs. Phillips she is now. She has two lovely
      children. Mr. Phillips is in charge of a department in Eaton's store."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't tell me," cried Larry. "How is dear Hazel? How I loved her
      once! I wonder where her father is and Tom and the little girl. What was
      her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ethel May. Oh, she is married too, in your old home, to Ben&mdash;somebody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ben, big Ben Hopper? Why, think of that kid married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is just my age," said Jane soberly, glad of the dusk of the falling
      night. She would have hated to have Larry see the quick flush that came to
      her cheek. Why the reference to Ethel May's marriage should have made her
      blush she hardly knew, and that itself was enough to annoy her, for Jane
      always knew exactly why she did things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. and Mrs. Sleighter," said Jane, continuing her narrative, "have
      gone to Toronto. They have become quite wealthy, Hazel says, and Tom is
      with his father in some sort of financial business. What is it, Papa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brown suddenly waked up. "What is what, my dear? You will have to
      forgive me. This wonderful scenery, these hills here and those mountains
      are absorbing my whole attention. So wonderful it all is that I hardly
      feel like apologising to Mrs. Waring-Gaunt for ignoring her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think of it," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Jane," continued Dr. Brown, "that at this present moment you
      are passing through scenery of its kind unsurpassed possibly in the
      world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was talking to Larry, Papa," said Jane, and they all laughed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was talking to Jane," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But look at this world about you," continued her father, "and look, do
      look at the moon coming up behind you away at the prairie rim." They all
      turned about except Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, whose eyes were glued to the two
      black ruts before her cutting through the grass. "Oh, wonderful,
      wonderful," breathed Dr. Brown. "Would it be possible to pause, Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt, at the top of this rise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "but at the top of the rise beyond, where
      you will get the full sweep of the country in both directions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that where we get your lake, Nora," inquired Jane, "and the valley
      beyond up to the mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?" said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember Larry told me once," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the spot," said Nora. "But don't look around now. Wait until you
      are told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Papa," said Jane in a quiet, matter-of-fact voice, "what is it that Tom
      is doing?" Larry shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, what Tom? Jane, my dear," said Dr. Brown in a pained voice, "does
      Tom matter much or any one else in the midst of all this glory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, Papa," said Jane firmly. "You matter, don't you? Everybody
      matters. Besides, we were told not to look until we reached the top."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Jane, you are an incorrigible Philistine," said her father, "and I
      yield. Tom's father is a broker, and Tom is by way of being a broker too,
      though I doubt if he is broking very much. May I dismiss Tom for a few
      minutes now?" Again they all laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see what you are all laughing at," said Jane, and lapsed into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," cried Nora, "in three minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the long, gently rising hill the motor pulled up, purring
      softly. They all stood up and gazed around about them. "Look back,"
      commanded Nora. "It is fifty miles to that prairie rim there." From their
      feet the prairie spread itself in long softly undulating billows to the
      eastern horizon, the hollows in shadow, the crests tipped with the silver
      of the rising moon. Here and there wreaths of mist lay just above the
      shadow lines, giving a ghostly appearance to the hills. "Now look this
      way," said Nora, and they turned about. Away to the west in a flood of
      silvery light the prairie climbed by abrupt steps, mounting ever higher
      over broken rocky points and rocky ledges, over bluffs of poplar and dark
      masses of pine and spruce, up to the grey, bare sides of the mighty
      mountains, up to their snow peaks gleaming elusive, translucent, faintly
      discernible against the blue of the sky. In the valley immediately at
      their feet the waters of the little lake gleamed like a polished shield
      set in a frame of ebony. "That's our lake," said Nora, "with our house
      just behind it in the woods. And nearer in that little bluff is Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunts home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Papa," said Jane softly, "we must not keep Mrs. Waring-Gaunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Jane," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "I fear I must go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you love it?" inquired Larry enthusiastically and with a touch of
      impatience in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, it is lovely," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Jane, you will not get wild over it," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get wild? I love it, really I do. But why should I get wild over it. Oh,
      I know you think, and Papa thinks, that I am awful. He says I have no
      poetry in me, and perhaps he is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the car stopped at the door of Mrs. Waring-Gaunt's house.
      "I shall just run in for a moment," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "Kathleen will
      want to see you, and perhaps will go home with you. I shall send her out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out from the vine-shadowed porch into the white light came Kathleen, stood
      a moment searching the faces of the party, then moved toward Dr. Brown
      with her hands eagerly stretched out. "Oh, Dr. Brown," she cried, "it is
      so good to see you here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my dear girl, my dear girl, how wonderful you look! Why, you have
      actually grown more beautiful than when we saw you last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, Dr. Brown. And there is Jane," cried Kathleen, running
      around to the other side of the car. "It is so lovely to see you and so
      good of you to come to us," she continued, putting her arms around Jane
      and kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to come, you know," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is Jane's fault entirely," said Dr. Brown. "I confess I hesitated
      to impose two people upon you this way, willy-nilly. But Jane would have
      it that you would be glad to have us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as usual Jane was right," said Larry with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Kathleen, "Jane was right. Jane is a dear to think that way
      about us. Dr. Brown," continued Kathleen with a note of anxiety in her
      voice, "Mrs. Waring-Gaunt wondered if you would mind coming in to see her
      brother. He was wounded with a gunshot in the arm about ten days ago. Dr.
      Hudson, who was one of your pupils, I believe, said he would like to have
      you see him when you came. I wonder if you would mind coming in now."
      Kathleen's face was flushed and her words flowed in a hurried stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, not at all," answered the doctor, rising hastily from the
      motor and going in with Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry," breathed Jane in a rapture of delight, "isn't she lovely,
      isn't she lovely? I had no idea she was so perfectly lovely." Not the
      moon, nor the glory of the landscape with all its wonder of plain and
      valley and mountain peak had been able to awaken Jane to ecstasy, but the
      rare loveliness of this girl, her beauty, her sweet simplicity, had
      kindled Jane to enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Jane, you are funny," said Larry. "You rave and go wild over
      Kathleen, and yet you keep quite cool over that most wonderful view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "View!" said Jane contemptuously. "No, wait, Larry, let me explain. I do
      think it all very wonderful, but I love people. People after all are
      better than mountains, and they are more wonderful too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they?" said Larry dubiously. "Not so lovely, sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people," insisted Jane, "are more wonderful than all the Rocky
      Mountains together. Look at Kathleen," she cried triumphantly. "You could
      not love that old mountain there, could you? But, Kathleen&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know about that," said Larry. "Dear old thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me how Mr. Romayne was hurt," said Jane, changing the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In graphic language Nora gave her the story of the accident with all the
      picturesque details, recounting Kathleen's part in it with appropriate
      emotional thrills. Jane listened with eyes growing wider with each
      horrifying elaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think his arm will ever be all right?" she inquired anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not know yet," said Nora sombrely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," interrupted Larry sharply. "His arm will be perfectly all
      right. You people make me tired with your passion for horrors and possible
      horrors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora was about to make a hot reply when Jane inquired quietly, "What does
      the doctor say? He ought to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said Nora. "He said yesterday he did not like the look
      of it at all. You know he did, Larry. Mrs. Waring-Gaunt told me so. They
      are quite anxious about it. But we will hear what Dr. Brown says and then
      we will know."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. Brown's report did not quite settle the matter, for after the
      approved manner of the profession he declined to commit himself to any
      definite statement except that it was a nasty wound, that it might easily
      have been worse, and he promised to look in with Dr. Hudson to-morrow.
      Meantime he expressed the profound hope that Mrs. Waring-Gaunt might get
      them as speedily as was consistent with safety to their destination, and
      that supper might not be too long delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can trust Mrs. Waring-Gaunt for the first," said Larry with
      confidence, "and mother for the second." In neither the one nor the other
      was Larry mistaken, for Mrs. Waring-Gaunt in a very few minutes discharged
      both passengers and freight at the Gwynnes' door, and supper was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We greatly appreciate your kindness, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt," said Dr. Brown,
      bowing courteously over her hand. "I shall look in upon your brother
      to-morrow morning. I hardly think there is any great cause for anxiety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you, Dr. Brown, I am glad to hear you say that. It would be
      very good of you to look in to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night," said Jane, her rare smile illuminating her dark face. "It
      was so good of you to come for us. It has been a delightful ride. I hope
      your brother will be better to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "I should be glad to have
      you come over to us. I am sure my brother would be glad to know you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so," said Jane doubtfully. "You know I am not very clever. I
      am not like Kathleen or Nora." The deep blue eyes looked wistfully at her
      out of the plain little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am perfectly certain he would love to know you, Jane&mdash;if I may
      call you so," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, impulsively kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are so kind," said Jane. "I will come then to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The welcome to the Gwynne home was without fuss or effusiveness but had
      the heart quality that needs no noisy demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are glad to have you with us at Lakeside Farm," said Mr. Gwynne
      heartily, as he ushered Dr. Brown and Jane into the big living room, where
      his wife stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are welcome to us, Dr. Brown," said the little lady. And something in
      the voice and manner made Dr. Brown know that the years that had passed
      since his first meeting with her had only deepened the feeling of
      gratitude and affection in her heart toward him. "We have not forgotten
      nor shall we ever forget your kindness to us when we were strangers
      passing through Winnipeg, nor your goodness to Larry and Kathleen while in
      Winnipeg. They have often told us of your great kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you may be quite sure, Mrs. Gwynne," said Dr. Brown heartily, "that
      Larry brought his welcome with him, and as for Kathleen, we regard her as
      one of our family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is Jane," said Mrs. Gwynne. "Dear child, you have grown. But you
      have not changed. Come away to your room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once behind the closed door she put her arms around the girl and kissed
      her. Then, holding her at arm's length, scrutinised her face with
      searching eyes. "No," she said again with a little sigh of relief, "you
      have not changed. You are the same dear, wise girl I learned to love in
      Winnipeg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am glad you think I am not changed, Mrs. Gwynne," said Jane, with a
      glow of light in her dark blue eyes. "I do not like people to change and I
      would hate to have you think me changed. I know," she added shyly, "I feel
      just the same toward you and the others here. But oh, how lovely they are,
      both Kathleen and Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are good girls," said Mrs. Gwynne quietly, "and they have proved
      good girls to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, I know," said Jane, with impulsive fervour, "and through those
      winters and all. Oh, they were so splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the mother, "they never failed, and Larry too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," cried Jane with increasing ardour, her eyes shining, "with
      his teaching,&mdash;going there through the awful cold,&mdash;lighting the
      school fires,&mdash;and the way he stuck to his college work. Nora's
      letters told me all about it. How splendid that was! And you know, Mrs.
      Gwynne, in the 'Varsity he did so well. I mean besides his standing in the
      class lists, in the Societies and in all the college life. He was really
      awfully popular," added Jane with something of a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell me, dear, sometime all about it. But now you must be weary
      and hungry. Come away out if you are ready, and I hope you will feel as if
      you were just one of ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, that is just the way I feel, Mrs. Gwynne," said Jane,
      putting the final touch to her toilet. "I seem to know the house, and
      everything and everybody about it. Nora is such a splendid correspondent,
      you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear child, we hope the days you spend here will always be a very
      bright spot in your life," said Mrs. Gwynne as they entered the living
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days saw the beginning of the realisation of that hope, for
      of all the bright spots in Jane's life none shone with a brighter and more
      certain lustre than the days of her visit to Lakeside Farm.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOSPITALITY WITHOUT GRUDGING
    </h3>
    <p>
      By arrangement made the previous evening Jane was awake before the family
      was astir and in Nora's hands preparing for a morning ride with Larry, who
      was to give her her first lesson in equitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your habit will be too big for me, Nora, I am afraid," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Habit!" cried Nora. "My pants, you mean. You can pull them up, you know.
      There they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pants!" gasped Jane. "Pants! Nora, pants! Do you mean to say you wear
      these things where all the men will see you?" Even in the seclusion of her
      bedroom Jane's face at the thought went a fiery red. Nora laughed at her
      scornfully. "Oh, but I can't possibly go out in these before Larry. I
      won't ride at all. Haven't you a skirt, a regular riding habit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nora derided her scruples. "Why, Jane, we all wear them here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Kathleen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course she does, and Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, and everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she might, but I am sure your mother would not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora shouted joyfully. "Well, that is true, she never has, but then she
      has never ridden out here. Put them on, hurry up, your legs are straight
      enough, your knees don't knock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Nora, they are just terrible," said Jane, almost in tears. "I know I
      will just squat down if Larry looks at me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should he look at you? Don't you ever let on but that you have worn
      them often, and he will never think of looking at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      In face of many protests Jane was at length arrayed in her riding apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you look perfectly stunning," said Nora. "You have got just the
      shape for them. Pull them up a little. There, that is better. Now step out
      and let me see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane walked across the room and Nora rocked in laughter. "Oh, Nora, I will
      just take them off. You are as mean as you can be. I will pull them off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," said Nora, still laughing, "only stretch your legs a bit when
      you walk. Don't mince along. Stride like a man. These men have had all the
      fun in the matter of clothes. I tell you it was one of the proudest
      moments of my life when I saw my own legs walking. Now step out and swing
      your arms. There, you are fine, a fine little chap, Jane, round as a
      barrel, and neat as a ballet dancer, although I never saw one except in
      magazines."
    </p>
    <p>
      Trim and neat Jane looked, the riding suit showing off the beautiful lines
      of her round, shapely figure. Shrinking, blushing, and horribly conscious
      of her pants, Jane followed Nora from her bedroom. A swift glance she
      threw around the room. To her joy it was empty but for Mrs. Gwynne, who
      was ready with a big glass of rich milk and a slice of home-made bread and
      delicious butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, my dear," said Mrs. Gwynne, kissing her. "You will need
      something before you ride. You will have breakfast after your return."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane went close to her and stood beside her, still blushing. "Oh, thank
      you," she cried, "I am really hungry already. I hope I won't get killed. I
      never was on a horse before, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never fear, Lawrence is very careful. If it were Nora now I would not
      be so sure about you, but Lawrence is quite safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Larry came in. "Well, Jane, all ready? Good for you. I like
      a girl that is always on time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you like her pants, Larry?" said Nora, wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly splendiferous," cried Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you mean thing, Nora," cried Jane, dropping hurriedly into a chair
      with scarlet face and indignant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, Jane, old chap, don't mind her. Those pants never looked so
      well before, I assure you. We are going to have a great time. I guarantee
      that in a few minutes you will be entirely oblivious of such trivial
      things as mere pants."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all passed out into the front yard to see Jane mount and take her
      first lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Polly," said Larry. "She has taught us all to ride, and though
      she has lost her shape a bit, she has still 'pep' enough to decline to
      take a dare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I do?" said Jane, gazing fearfully at the fat and shapeless
      Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is just one rule in learning to ride," said Larry, "step on and
      stick there. Polly will look after the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Step on&mdash;it is easy to say, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This way," said Nora. She seized hold of the horn of the saddle, put her
      foot into the stirrup and sprang upon Polly's back. "Oh, there's where the
      pants come in," she added as her dress caught on to the rear of the
      saddle. "Now up you go. Make up your mind you are going to DO it, not
      going to TRY."
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of serious determination came into Jane's face, a look that her
      friends would have recognised as the precursor of a resolute and
      determined attempt to achieve the thing in hand. She seized the horn of
      the saddle, put her foot into the stirrup and "stepped on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The riding lesson was an unqualified success, though for some reason,
      known only to herself, Polly signalised the event by promptly running away
      immediately her head was turned homeward, and coming back down the lane at
      a thundering gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" cried Nora, running out to meet them. "Why, Jane, you have been
      fooling us all along. You needn't tell me this is your first ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My very first," said Jane, "but I hope not my last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear," said Mrs. Gwynne, who had also come out to see the return,
      "you are doing famously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" cried Jane, her face aglow and her eyes shining. "I think it is
      splendid. Shall we ride again to-day, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right away after breakfast and all day long if you like. You are a born
      horsewoman, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weren't you afraid when Polly ran off with you like that?" inquired Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid? I didn't know there was any danger. Was there any?" inquired
      Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," said Nora, "so long as you kept your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there really was no danger, was there, Larry?" insisted Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None at all, Jane," said Nora, "I assure you. Larry got rattled when he
      saw you tear off in that wild fashion, but I knew you would be all right.
      Come in; breakfast is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so am I," said Jane. "I haven't been so hungry I don't know when."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she's not plain-looking after all," said Nora to her mother as Jane
      strode manlike off to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plain-looking?" exclaimed her mother. "I never thought her plain-looking.
      She has that beauty that shines from within, a beauty that never fades,
      but grows with every passing year."
    </p>
    <p>
      A council of war was called by Nora immediately after breakfast, at which
      plans were discussed for the best employment of the three precious days
      during which the visitors were to be at the ranch. There were so many
      things to be done that unless some system were adopted valuable time would
      be wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It appears to me, Miss Nora," said Dr. Brown after a somewhat prolonged
      discussion, "that to accomplish all the things that you have suggested,
      and they all seem not only delightful but necessary, we shall require at
      least a month of diligent application."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the very least," cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So what are we going to do?" said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was finally decided that the Browns should extend their stay at
      Lakeside House for a week, after which the doctor should proceed to the
      coast and be met on his return at Banff by Jane, with Nora as her guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that's all settled," said Larry. "Now what's for to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to that question a honk of a motor car was heard outside.
      Nora rushed to the door, saying, "That's Mrs. Waring-Gaunt." But she
      returned hastily with heightened colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry," she said, "it's that Mr. Wakeham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wakeham," cried Larry. "What's got him up so early, I wonder?" with a
      swift look at Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," said Nora, giving Jane a little dig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I would just run up and see if you had all got home safely last
      night," they heard his great voice booming outside to Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My, but he is anxious," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who is he, Nora?" inquired her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend of Jane's, and apparently terribly concerned about her welfare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Nora," said Jane, flushing a fiery red. "Don't be silly. He is a
      young man whom we met on the train, Mrs. Gwynne, a friend of some of our
      Winnipeg friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall be very glad to have him stay with us, my dear," said Mrs.
      Gwynne. "Go and bring him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, Jane," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Nora, stop it," said Jane. "I will get really cross with you. Hush,
      there he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man seemed to fill up the door with his bulk. "Mr. Wakeham,"
      said Larry, as the young fellow stood looking around on the group with a
      frank, expansive smile upon his handsome face. As his eye fell upon a
      little lady the young man seemed to come to attention. Insensibly he
      appeared to assume an attitude of greater respect as he bowed low over her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will pardon my coming here so early in the morning," he said
      with an embarrassed air. "I have the honour of knowing your guests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any friend of our guests is very welcome here, Mr. Wakeham," said Mrs.
      Gwynne, smiling at him with gentle dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mr. Wakeham," said Jane, coming forward with outstretched
      hand. "You are very early in your calls. You could not have slept very
      much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," replied Mr. Wakeham, "and that is one reason why I waked so
      early. My bed was not so terribly attractive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," exclaimed Nora in a disappointed tone, as she shook hands with him,
      "we thought you were anxious to see us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right," said the young man, holding her hand and looking boldly
      into her eyes. "I have come to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his look Nora's saucy eyes fell and for some unaccountable reason
      her usually ready speech forsook her. Mr. Wakeham fell into easy
      conversation with Mr. Gwynne and Dr. Brown concerning mining matters, in
      which he was especially interested. He had spent an hour about the Manor
      Mine and there he had heard a good deal about Mr. Gwynne's mine and was
      anxious to see that if there were no objections. He wondered if he might
      drive Mr. Gwynne&mdash;and indeed, he had a large car and would be glad to
      fill it up with a party if any one cared to come. He looked at Mrs. Gwynne
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mother, you go. It is such a lovely day," said Nora
      enthusiastically, "and Jane can go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane is going riding," said Larry firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to Mrs. Waring-Gaunt's," said Jane. "I arranged with her last
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were settling Mrs. Gwynne's protests, and covered by the noise
      of conversation, Mr. Wakeham managed to get close to Nora. "I want you to
      come," he said in a low voice. "That's what I came for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled and confused by this extraordinary announcement, Nora could think
      of no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you were to show me the mine," he added. Then while Nora gasped
      at him, he said aloud, "My car is a seven passenger, so we can take quite
      a party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not Kathleen?" suggested Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, Kathleen might like to go," said Mrs. Gwynne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let's all go," cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you awfully," murmured Mr. Wakeham. "We shall only be two or three
      hours at most," continued Nora. "We shall be back in time for lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For that matter," said Mr. Gwynne, "we can lunch at the mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid," cried Nora. "Come along. We'll run up with you to the
      Waring-Gaunts' for Kathleen," she added to Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Waring-Gaunts' they had some difficulty persuading Kathleen to join
      the party, but under the united influence of Jack and his sister, she
      agreed to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "you have your full party, Mr. Wakeham&mdash;Mr.
      and Mrs. Gwynne, Dr. Brown, and the three girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about me?" said Larry dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall stay with you," cried Nora, evading Mr. Wakeham's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Nora," said Jane in a voice of quiet decision. "Last night Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt and I arranged that I should visit her to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud chorus of protests, each one making an alternative
      suggestion during which Jane went to Mrs. Waring-Gaunt's side and said
      quietly, "I want to stay with you to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, dear," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "Stay you shall." And, then to
      the company announced, "We have it all arranged. Jane and I are to have a
      visit together. The rest of you go off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about me, Jane?" again said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going with the others," said Jane calmly, "and in the afternoon
      we are to have our ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is Jane," said Jack Romayne as Mrs. Waring-Gaunt ushered the
      girl into his room. "If half of what I have heard is true then I am a
      lucky man to-day. Kathleen has been telling me about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's smile expressed her delight. "I think I could say the same of you,
      Mr. Romayne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Has Kathleen been talking about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have not seen Kathleen since I came, but there are others, you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there?" asked Jack. "I hadn't noticed. But I know all about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hasty introduction for Jane. Kathleen was easily a subject for a
      day's conversation. How long she discoursed upon Kathleen neither of them
      knew. But when Mrs. Waring-Gaunt had finished up her morning household
      duties Jane was still busy dilating upon Kathleen's charms and graces and
      expatiating upon her triumphs and achievements during her stay in Winnipeg
      the previous winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still upon Kathleen?" inquired Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am learning a great deal and enjoying myself immensely," said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be careful, Jane. Don't tell Jack everything about Kathleen.
      There are certain things we keep to ourselves, you know. I don't tell Tom
      everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane opened her eyes. "I have not told Jane yet, Sybil," said Jack
      quietly. "She doesn't know, though perhaps she has guessed how dear to me
      Kathleen is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you not heard?" inquired Mrs. Waring-Gaunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I only came last night, you see." Then turning to Jack, she added,
      "And is&mdash;is Kathleen going to marry you?" Her astonishment was
      evident in her voice and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Jack, "and you are no more astonished than I am myself.
      I only found it out night before last."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Jane that she sat gazing at him in silence; her
      tongue had not learned the trick of easy compliment. She was trying to
      take in the full meaning of this surprising announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Jack after he had waited for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I beg your pardon," she said hurriedly. "I congratulate you. I think
      you are a very lucky man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, indeed," said Jack with emphasis. "And Kathleen? You are not so
      sure about her luck?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know you yet," said Jane gravely, "and Kathleen is a very
      lovely girl, the very loveliest girl I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right," said Jack in a tone as grave as her own. "I am not
      good enough for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I did not say that. Only I don't know you, and you see I know
      Kathleen. She is so lovely and so good. I love her." Jane's face was
      earnest and grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so do I, Jane, if I may call you so," said Jack, "and I am going to
      try to be worthy of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's eyes rested quietly on his face. She made up her mind that it was
      an honest face and a face one could trust, but to Jane it seemed as if
      something portentous had befallen her friend and she could not bring
      herself immediately to accept this new situation with an outburst of
      joyous acclaim such as ordinarily greets an announcement of this kind. For
      a reason she could not explain her mind turned to the memory she cherished
      of her own mother and of the place she had held with her father. She
      wondered if this man could give to Kathleen a place so high and so secure
      in his heart. While her eyes were on his face Jack could see that her mind
      was far away. She was not thinking of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Jane?" he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane started and the blood rushed to her face. She hesitated, then said
      quietly but with charming frankness, "I was thinking of my mother. She
      died when I was two years old. Father says I am like her. But I am not at
      all. She was very lovely. Kathleen makes me think of her, and father often
      tells me about her. He has never forgotten her. You see I think he loved
      her in quite a wonderful way, and he&mdash;" Jane paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waring-Gaunt rose quietly, came to her side. "Dear Jane, dear child,"
      she said, kissing her. "That's the only way to love. I am sure your mother
      was a lovely woman, and a very happy woman, and you are like her."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jack kept his face turned away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. Waring-Gaunt," cried Jane, shaking her head emphatically, "I am
      not the least bit like her. That is one of the points on which I disagree
      with father. We do not agree upon everything, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? What are some of the other points?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We agree splendidly about Kathleen," said Jane, laughing. "Just now we
      differ about Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha, how is that?" inquired Jack, immediately alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I know very little about it, you understand, but last winter
      our minister, Mr. McPherson, who had just been on a visit to Germany the
      summer before, gave a lecture in which he said that Germany had made
      enormous preparations for war and was only waiting a favourable moment to
      strike. Papa says that is all nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jane, Jane," cried Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "you have struck upon a very
      sore spot in this house. Jack will indorse all your minister said. He will
      doubtless go much further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he say, Jane?" inquired Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was greatly in earnest and he urged preparation by Canada. He thinks
      we ought at the very least to begin getting our fleet ready right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's politics, of course," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "and I do not know
      what you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure that I do either," she replied, "but I believe too that
      Canada ought to get at her fleet without loss of time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what did he say about Germany?" continued Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you everything, of course, but he assured us that Germany
      had made the greatest possible preparation, that the cities, towns and
      villages were full of drilling men; that there were great stores of war
      material, guns and shells, everywhere throughout Germany; that they were
      preparing fleets of Zeppelins and submarines too; that they were ready to
      march at twenty-four hours' notice; that the whole railroad system of
      Germany was organised, was really built for war; that within the last few
      years the whole nation had come to believe that Germany must go to war in
      order to fulfil her great destiny. Father says that this is all foolish
      talk, and that all this war excitement is prompted chiefly by professional
      soldiers, like Lord Roberts and others, and by armament makers like the
      Armstrongs and the Krupps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think about it all, Jane?" inquired Jack, looking at her
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he had spent some months in Germany and had taken pains to inquire
      of all kinds of people, officers and professors and preachers and working
      people and politicians, and so I think he ought to know better than others
      who just read books and the newspapers, don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are entirely right, and I hope that minister of yours will
      deliver that lecture in many places throughout this country, for there are
      not many people, even in England, who believe in the reality of the German
      menace. But this is my hobby, my sister says, and I don't want to bore
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am really interested, Mr. Romayne. Papa laughs at me, and Larry
      too. He does not believe in the possibility of war. But I think that if
      there is a chance, even the slightest chance, of it being true, it is so
      terrible that we all ought to be making preparation to defend ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it won't bore you," said Jack, "I shall tell you a few things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then excuse me," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "I have some matters to attend
      to. I have no doubt that you at least, Jack, will have a perfectly lovely
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I shall too," cried Jane enthusiastically. "I just want to hear
      about this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you please pass me that green book?" said Jack, after Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt had left the room. "No, the next one. Yes. The first thing
      that it is almost impossible for us Britishers to get into our minds is
      this, that Germany, not simply the Kaiser and the governing classes, but
      the whole body of the German people, take themselves and their empire and
      their destiny with most amazing seriousness. Listen to this, for instance.
      This will give you, I say, the psychological condition out of which war
      may easily and naturally arise." He turned the leaves of the book and
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To live and expand at the expense of other less meritorious peoples
      finds its justification in the conviction that we are of all people the
      most noble and the most pure, destined before others to work for the
      highest development of humanity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of their poets&mdash;I haven't got him here&mdash;speaks of the
      'German life curing all the evils of humanity by mere contact with it.'
      You see that row of books? These are only a few. Most of them are German.
      They are all by different authors and on different subjects, but they are
      quite unanimous in setting forth the German ideal, the governing principle
      of German World politics. They are filled with the most unbelievable
      glorification of Germany and the German people, and the most extraordinary
      prophecies as to her wonderful destiny as a World Power. Unhappily the
      German has no sense of humour. A Britisher talking in this way about his
      country would feel himself to be a fool. Not so the German. With a
      perfectly serious face he will attribute to himself and to his nation all
      the virtues in the calendar. For instance, listen to this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Domination belongs to Germany because it is a superior nation, a noble
      race, and it is fitting that it should control its neighbours just as it
      is the right and duty of every individual endowed with superior intellect
      and force to control inferior individuals about him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's another choice bit:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We are the superior race in the fields of science and of art. We are the
      best colonists, the best sailors, the best merchants.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's one thing. Then here's another. For many years after his accession
      I believe the Kaiser was genuinely anxious to preserve the peace of Europe
      and tried his best to do so, though I am bound to say that at times he
      adopted rather peculiar methods, a mingling of bullying and intrigue. But
      now since 1904&mdash;just hand me that thin book, please. Thank you&mdash;the
      Kaiser has changed his tone. For instance, listen to this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'God has called us to civilise the world. We are the missionaries of
      human progress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And again this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The German people will be the block of granite on which our Lord will be
      able to elevate and achieve the civilisation of the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I need not weary you with quotations. The political literature of
      Germany for the last fifteen years is saturated with this spirit. The
      British people dismiss this with a good-natured smile of contempt. To them
      it is simply an indication of German bad breeding. If you care I shall
      have a number of these books sent you. They are somewhat difficult to get.
      Indeed, some of them cannot be had in English at all. But you read German,
      do you not? Kathleen told me about your German prize."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, a little. But I confess I prefer the English," said Jane with a
      little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The chief trouble, however, is that so few English-speaking people care
      to read them. But I assure you that the one all-absorbing topic of the
      German people is this one of Germany's manifest destiny to rule and
      elevate the world. And remember these two things go together. They have no
      idea of dominating the world intellectually or even commercially&mdash;but
      perhaps you are sick of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I am very greatly interested," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall just read you one thing more. The German has no idea that he
      can benefit a nation until he conquers it. Listen to this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The dominion of German thought can only be extended under the aegis of
      political power, and unless we act in conformity to this idea we shall be
      untrue to out great duties toward the human race.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very glad to get those books," said Jane, "and I wish you
      would mark some of these passages. And I promise you I shall do all I can
      to make all my friends read them. I shall begin with Papa and Larry. They
      are always making fun of me and my German scare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can quite understand that," replied Jack. "That is a very common
      attitude with a great majority of the people of England to-day. But you
      see I have been close to these things for years, and I have personal
      knowledge of many of the plans and purposes in the minds of the German
      Kaiser and the political and military leaders of Germany, and unhappily I
      know too the spirit that dominates the whole body of the German people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lived in Germany for some years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for a number of years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you like the life there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In many ways I did. I met some charming Germans, and then there is always
      their superb music."
    </p>
    <p>
      And for an hour Jack Romayne gave his listener a series of vivid pictures
      of his life in Germany and in other lands for the past ten years, mingling
      with personal reminiscences incidents connected with international
      politics and personages. He talked well, not only because his subject was
      a part of himself, but also because Jane possessed that rare ability to
      listen with intelligence and sympathy. Never had she met with a man who
      had been in such intimate touch with the world's Great Affairs and who was
      possessed at the same time of such brilliant powers of description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before either of them was aware the party from the mine had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have had a perfectly glorious time," cried Nora as she entered the
      room with her cheeks and eyes glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have we, Miss Nora," said Jack. "In fact, I had not the slightest idea
      of the flight of time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may say so," exclaimed Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "These two have been so
      utterly absorbed in each other that my presence in the room or absence
      from it was a matter of perfect indifference. And how Jane managed it I
      don't know, but she got Jack to do for her what he has never done for me.
      He has actually been giving her the story of his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane stood by listening with a smile of frank delight on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you do it, Jane?" asked Kathleen shyly. "He has never told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I just listened," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a nasty jar for you others," said Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he told me something else, Kathleen," said Jane with a bright blush,
      "and I am awfully glad." As she spoke she went around to Kathleen and,
      kissing her, said, "It is perfectly lovely for you both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you really mean that, do you?" said Jack. "You know she was
      exceedingly dubious of me this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am not now," said Jane. "I know you better, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God," said Jack fervently. "The day has not been lost. You will be
      sure to come again to see me," he added as Jane said good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, you may be quite sure of that," replied Jane, smiling
      brightly back at him as she left the room with Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity she is so plain," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt when she had
      returned from seeing Jane on her way with Nora and Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Sybil, you waste your pity," said her brother. "That young lady
      is so attractive that one forgets whether she is plain or not. I can't
      quite explain her fascination for me. There's perfect sincerity to begin
      with. She is never posing. And perfect simplicity. And besides that she is
      so intellectually keen, she keeps one alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just love her," said Kathleen. "She has such a good heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have said it," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt, "and that is why Jane will
      never lose her charm."

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRAGEDIES OF LOVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the week had fled Dr. Brown could hardly persuade himself and his
      hosts at Lakeside Farm that the time had come for his departure to the
      coast. Not since he had settled down to the practice of his profession at
      Winnipeg more than twenty years ago had such a holiday been his. Alberta,
      its climate, its life of large spaces and far visions, its hospitable
      people, had got hold of him by so strong a grip that in parting he vowed
      that he would not await an opportunity but make one to repeat his visit to
      the ranch. And so he departed with the understanding that Jane should
      follow him to Banff ten days later with her friend Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ten days were to Jane as a radiant, swiftly moving dream. Yet with so
      much to gratify her, one wish had remained ungratified. Though from early
      morning until late night she had ridden the ranges now with one and now
      with another, but for the most part with Larry, Jane had never "done the
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I just know I shall go away without seeing that mine, and Winnipeg
      people will be sure to ask me about it, and what shall I say? And I have
      never seen that wonderful secretary, Mr. Switzer, either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow," said Larry solemnly, "no matter what happens we shall have
      you see that mine and the wonderful Mr. Switzer."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the seeing of Mr. Switzer that brought to Jane the only touch of
      tragedy to the perfect joy of her visit to Alberta. Upon arrival at the
      mine she was given over by Larry to Mr. Switzer's courteous and
      intelligent guidance, and with an enthusiasm that never wearied, her guide
      left nothing of the mine outside or in, to which with painstaking
      minuteness he failed to call her attention. It was with no small degree of
      pride that Mr. Switzer explained all that had been accomplished during the
      brief ten weeks during which the mine had been under his care. For
      although it was quite true that Mr. Steinberg was the manager, Switzer
      left no doubt in Jane's mind, as there was none in his own, that the mine
      owed its present state of development to his driving energy and to his
      organising ability. Jane readily forgave him his evident pride in himself
      as he exclaimed, sweeping his hand toward the little village that lay
      along the coolee,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten weeks ago, Miss Brown, there was nothing here but a little black hole
      in the hillside over there. To-day look at it. We have a company
      organised, a village built and equipped with modern improvements, water,
      light, drainage, etc. We are actually digging and shipping coal. It is all
      very small as yet, but it is something to feel that a beginning has been
      made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is really quite a remarkable achievement, Mr. Switzer. And I
      feel sure that I do not begin to know all that this means. They all say
      that you have accomplished great things in the short time you have been at
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are only beginning," said Switzer again, "but I believe we shall have
      a great mine. It will be a good thing&mdash;for the Gwynnes, I mean&mdash;and
      that is worth while. Of course, my own money is invested here too and I am
      working for myself, but I assure you that I chiefly think of them. It is a
      joy, Miss Brown, to work for those you love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied Jane, slightly puzzled at this altruistic point of view;
      "The Gwynnes are dear people and I am glad for their sakes. I love them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued Switzer, "this will be a great mine. They will be wealthy
      some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be splendid," said Jane. "You see I have only got to know them
      well during this visit. Nine years ago I met them in Winnipeg when I was a
      little girl. Of course, Kathleen was with us a great deal last winter. I
      got to know her well then. She is so lovely, and she is lovelier now than
      ever. She is so happy, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Switzer looked puzzled. "Happy? Because you are here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no. Because of her engagement. Haven't you heard? I thought everybody
      knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      Switzer stood still in his tracks. "Her engagement?" he said in a hushed
      voice. "Her engagement to&mdash;to that"&mdash;he could not apparently get
      the word out without a great effort&mdash;"that Englishman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at his white face and listening to his tense voice, Jane felt as
      if she were standing at the edge of a mine that might explode at any
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to Mr. Romayne," she said, and waited, almost holding her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true!" he shouted. "It's a lie. Ha, Ha." Switzer's laugh was
      full of incredulous scorn. "Engaged? And how do YOU know?" He swung
      fiercely upon her, his eyes glaring out of a face ghastly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I said anything, Mr. Switzer. It was not my business to speak
      of it," said Jane quietly. "But I thought you knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the thing seemed to reach his mind. "Your business?" he said.
      "What difference whose business it is? It is not true. I say it is not
      true. How do you know? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me." He seized her by the
      arm, and at each "Tell me" shook her violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are hurting me, Mr. Switzer," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped her arm. "Then, my God, will you not tell me? How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Switzer, believe me it is true," said Jane, trying to speak quietly,
      though she was shaking with excitement and terror. "Mr. Romayne told me,
      they all told me, Kathleen told me. It is quite true, Mr. Switzer."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her as if trying to take in the meaning of her words, then
      glared around him like a hunted animal seeking escape from a ring of foes,
      then back at her again. There were workmen passing close to them on the
      path, but he saw nothing of them. Jane was looking at his ghastly face.
      She was stricken with pity for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we walk on this way?" she said, touching his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook off her touch but followed her away from the busy track of the
      workers, along a quieter path among the trees. Sheltered from observation,
      she slowed her steps and turned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She loves him?" he said in a low husky voice. "You say she loves him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Switzer, she loves him," said Jane. "She cannot help herself. No
      one can help one's self. You must not blame her for that, Mr. Switzer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not love me," said Switzer as if stunned by the utterly
      inexplicable phenomenon. "But she did once," he cried. "She did before
      that schwein came." No words could describe the hate and contempt in his
      voice. He appeared to concentrate his passions struggling for expression,
      love, rage, hate, wounded pride, into one single stream of fury. Grinding
      his teeth, foaming, sputtering, he poured forth his words in an impetuous
      torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He stole her from me! this schwein of an Englishman! He came like a
      thief, like a dog and a dog's son and stole her! She was mine! She would
      have been mine! She loved me! She was learning to love me. I was too quick
      with her once, but she had forgiven me and was learning to love me. But
      this pig!" He gnashed his teeth upon the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Mr. Switzer," said Jane, controlling her agitation and her terror.
      "You must not speak to me like that. You are forgetting yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgetting myself!" he raged, his face livid blue and white. "Forgetting
      myself! Yes, yes! I forget everything but one thing. That I shall not
      forget. I shall not forget him nor how he stole her from me. Gott in
      Himmel! Him I shall never forget. No, when these hairs are white," he
      struck his head with his clenched fist, "I shall still remember and curse
      him." Abruptly he stayed the rush of his words. Then more deliberately but
      with an added intensity of passion he continued, "But no, never shall he
      have her. Never. God hears me. Never. Him I will kill, destroy." He had
      wrought himself up into a paroxysm of uncontrollable fury, his breath came
      in jerking gasps, his features worked with convulsive twitchings, his jaws
      champed and snapped upon his words like a dog's worrying rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jane it seemed a horrible and repulsive sight, yet she could not stay
      her pity from him. She remembered it was love that had moved him to this
      pitch of madness. Love after all was a terrible thing. She could not
      despise him. She could only pity. Her very silence at length recalled him.
      For some moments he stood struggling to regain his composure. Gradually he
      became aware that her eyes were resting on his face. The pity in her eyes
      touched him, subdued him, quenched the heat of his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lost her," he said, his lips quivering. "She will never change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she will never change," replied Jane gently. "But you can always love
      her. And she will be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will be happy?" he exclaimed, looking at her in astonishment. "But
      she will not be mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she will not be yours," said Jane still very gently, "but she will be
      happy, and after all, that is what you most want. You are anxious chiefly
      that she shall be happy. You would give everything to make her happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would give my life. Oh, gladly, gladly, I would give my life, I would
      give my soul, I would give everything I have on earth and heaven too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then don't grieve too much," said Jane, putting her hand on his arm. "She
      will be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what of me?" he cried pitifully, his voice and lips trembling like
      those of a little child in distress. "Shall I be happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not now," replied Jane steadily, striving to keep back her tears,
      "perhaps some day. But you will think more of her happiness than of your
      own. Love, you know, seeks to make happy rather than to be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments the man stood as if trying to understand what she had
      said. Then with a new access of grief and rage, he cried, "But my God! My
      God! I want her. I cannot live without her. I could make her happy too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, never," said Jane. "She loves him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach&mdash;so. Yes, she loves him, and I&mdash;hate him. He is the cause
      of this. Some day I will kill him. I will kill him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then she would never be happy again," said Jane, and her face was full of
      pain and of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away," he said harshly. "Go away. You know not what you say. Some day
      I shall make him suffer as I suffer to-day. God hears me. Some day." He
      lifted his hands high above his head. Then with a despairing cry, "Oh, I
      have lost her, I have lost her," he turned from Jane and rushed into the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaken, trembling and penetrated with pity for him, Jane made her way
      toward the office, near which she found Larry with the manager discussing
      an engineering problem which appeared to interest them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Ernest?" inquired Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has just gone," said Jane, struggling to speak quietly. "I think we
      must hurry, Larry. Come, please. Good-bye, Mr. Steinberg." She hurried
      away toward the horses, leaving Larry to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Jane?" said Larry when they were on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you tell me, Larry, that he was fond of Kathleen?" she cried
      indignantly. "I hurt him terribly, and, oh, it was awful to see a man like
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say? Did he cut up rough?" said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane made no reply, but her face told its own story of shock and
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He need not have let out upon you, Jane, anyway," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Larry. You don't understand. He loves Kathleen. You don't know
      anything about it. How can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he will get over it in time," said Larry with a slight laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane flashed on him a look of indignation. "Oh, how can you, Larry? It was
      just terrible to see him. But you do not know," she added with a touch of
      bitterness unusual with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thing I do know," said Larry. "I would not pour out my grief on some
      one else. I would try to keep it to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane refused to look at him or to speak again on the matter. Never in
      her sheltered life had there been anything suggesting tragedy. Never had
      she seen a strong man stricken to the heart as she knew this man to be
      stricken. The shadow of that tragedy stayed with her during all the
      remaining days of her visit. The sight of Kathleen's happy face never
      failed to recall the face of the man who loved her distorted with agony
      and that cry of despair, "I have lost her, I have lost her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that her last days at the ranch were not happy days. She was far too
      healthy and wholesome, far too sane to allow herself to miss the gladness
      of those last few days with her friends where every moment offered its
      full measure of joy. Nora would have planned a grand picnic for the last
      day on which the two households, including Jack Romayne, who by this time
      was quite able to go about, were to pay a long-talked-of visit to a famous
      canyon in the mountains. The party would proceed to the canyon in the two
      cars, for Mr. Wakeham's car and Mr. Wakeham's person as driver had been
      constantly at the service of the Gwynnes and their guests during their
      stay at the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that is our very last day, Nora," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's just why," replied Nora. "We shall wind up our festivities
      in one grand, glorious finale."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the wise mother interposed. "It is a long ride, Nora, and you don't
      want to be too tired for your journey. I think the very last day we had
      better spend quietly at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's eyes flashed upon her a grateful look. And so it came that the
      grand finale was set back to the day before the last, and proved to be a
      gloriously enjoyable if exhausting outing. The last day was spent by Nora
      in making preparations for her visit with Jane to Banff and in putting the
      final touches to such household tasks as might help to lessen somewhat the
      burden for those who would be left behind. Jane spent the morning in a
      farewell visit to the Waring-Gaunts', which she made in company with
      Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, my dear Jane, you have enjoyed your stay with us here at Wolf
      Willow," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt as Jane was saying good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been very happy," said Jane. "Never in my life have I had such a
      happy time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now it is good of you to say that," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "You have
      made us all love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," said her husband. "Repetition of the great Caesar's
      experience veni vidi vici, eh? What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So say I," said Jack Romayne. "It has been a very real pleasure to know
      you, Jane. For my part, I shan't forget your visit to me, and the talks we
      have had together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have all been good to me. I cannot tell you how I feel about it."
      Jane's voice was a little tremulous, but her smile was as bright as ever.
      "I don't believe I shall ever have such a perfectly happy visit again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense, my dear," said Mrs. Waring-Gaunt. "I predict many, many
      very happy days for you. You have that beautiful gift of bringing your joy
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack accompanied them on their way to the road. "Kathleen and I are hoping
      that perhaps you may be able to come to our wedding. It will be very soon&mdash;in
      a few weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, could you, Jane, dear?" said Kathleen. "We should like it above
      everything else. I know it is a long, long journey, but if you could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When is it to be?" said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhere about the middle of October." But Jane shook her head
      disconsolately. By that time she knew she would be deep in her university
      work, and with Jane work ever came before play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid not," she said. "But, oh, I do wish you all the happiness in
      the world. Nothing has ever made me so glad. Oh, but you will be happy, I
      know. Both of you are so lovely." A sudden rush of tears filled the deep
      dark eyes as she shook hands with Jack in farewell. "But," she cried in
      sudden rapture, "why not come to us for a day on your wedding trip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a splendid idea." For a moment or two Jack and Kathleen stood
      looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, we shall surely come. You may count on us," said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Mrs. Gwynne sent Jane away for a ride with Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just go quietly, Larry," said his mother. "Don't race and don't tire
      Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take care of her," said Larry, "but I won't promise that we won't
      race. Jane would not stand for that, you know. Besides she is riding
      Ginger, and Ginger is not exactly like old Polly. But never fear, we shall
      have a good ride, Mother," he added, waving his hand gaily as they rode
      away, taking the coolee trail to the timber lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry was in high spirits. He talked of his work for the winter. He was
      hoping great things from this his last year in college. For the first time
      in his university career he would be able to give the full term to study.
      He would be a couple of weeks late on account of Kathleen's marriage, but
      he would soon make that up. He had his work well in hand and this year he
      meant to do something worth while. "I should like to take that medal home
      to Mother," he said with a laugh. "I just fancy I see her face. She would
      try awfully hard not to seem proud, but she would just be running over
      with it." Jane gave, as ever, a sympathetic hearing but she had little to
      say, even less than was usual with her. Her smile, however, was as quick
      and as bright as ever, and Larry chattered on beside her apparently
      unaware of her silence. Up the coolee and through the woods and back by
      the dump their trail led them. On the way home they passed the Switzer
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Mr. Switzer?" said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by Jove, he hasn't been near us for a week, has he?" replied Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor man, I feel so sorry for him," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he will be all right. He is busy with his work. He is awfully keen
      about that mine of his, and once the thing is over&mdash;after Kathleen is
      married, I mean&mdash;it will be different."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane rode on in silence for some distance. Then she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder how much you know about it, Larry. I don't think you know the
      very least bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps not," said Larry cheerfully, "but they always get over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do they?" said Jane. "I wonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      And again she rode on listening in silence to Larry's chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have a delightful visit at Banff, Jane. Do you know Wakeham is
      going to motor up? He is to meet his father there. He asked me to go with
      him," and as he spoke Larry glanced at her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be splendid for you, Larry," she said, "but you couldn't leave
      them at home with all the work going on, could you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Larry gloomily, "I do not suppose I could. But I think you
      might have let me say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is true, isn't it, Larry?" said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's true, and there's no use talking about it, and so I told him.
      But," he said, cheering up again, "I have been having a holiday these two
      weeks since you have been here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Jane remorsefully, "we must have cut into your work
      dreadfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have loafed a bit, but it was worth while. What a jolly time we
      have had! At least, I hope you have had, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't need to ask me, do you, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. You are so dreadfully secretive as to your feelings, one
      never knows about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you are talking nonsense," replied Jane hotly. "You know quite well
      that I have enjoyed every minute of my visit here."
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode in silence for some time, then Larry said, "Jane, you are the
      best chum a fellow ever had. You never expect a chap to pay you special
      attention or make love to you. There is none of that sort of nonsense
      about you, is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Larry," said Jane simply, but she kept her face turned away from him.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The results of the University examinations filled three sheets of the
      Winnipeg morning papers. With eager eyes and anxious hearts hundreds of
      the youth of Manitoba and the other western provinces scanned these lists.
      It was a veritable Day of Judgment, a day of glad surprises for the
      faithful in duty and the humble in heart, a day of Nemesis for the vainly
      self-confident slackers who had grounded their hopes upon eleventh hour
      cramming and lucky shots in exam papers. There were triumphs which won
      universal approval, others which received grudging praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the former, none of those, in the Junior year at least, gave more
      general satisfaction than did Jane Brown's in the winning of the German
      prize over Heinrich Kellerman, and for a number of reasons. In the first
      place Jane beat the German in his own language, at his own game, so to
      speak. Then, too, Jane, while a hard student, took her full share in
      college activities, and carried through these such a spirit of generosity
      and fidelity as made her liked and admired by the whole body of the
      students. Kellerman, on the other hand, was of that species of student
      known as a pot-hunter, who took no interest in college life, but devoted
      himself solely to the business of getting for himself everything that the
      college had to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Jane alone, of his fellow students, gave a single thought to the
      disappointment of the little Jew. She alone knew how keenly he had striven
      for the prize, and how surely he had counted upon winning it. She had the
      feeling, too, that somehow the class lists did not represent the relative
      scholarship of the Jew and herself. He knew more German than she. It was
      this feeling that prompted her to write him a note which brought an answer
      in formal and stilted English.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Miss Brown," the answer ran, "I thank you for your beautiful note,
      which is so much like yourself that in reading it I could see your smile,
      which so constantly characterises you to all your friends. I confess to
      disappointment, but the disappointment is largely mitigated by the
      knowledge that the prize which I failed to acquire went to one who is so
      worthy of it, and for whom I cherish the emotions of profound esteem and
      good will. Your devoted and disappointed rival, Heinrich Kellerman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather sporting of him, isn't it?" said Jane to her friend Ethel Murray,
      who had come to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sporting?" said Ethel. "It is the last thing I would have said about
      Kellerman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the worst of prizes," said Jane, "some one has to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just the way I feel about Mr. MacLean," said Ethel. "He ought to have had
      the medal and not I. He knows more philosophy in a minute than I in a
      week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wouldn't say that," said Jane judicially. "And though I am awfully
      glad you got it, Ethel, I am sorry for Mr. MacLean. You know he is working
      his way through college, and has to keep up a mission through the term. He
      is a good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he is good, a little too good," said Ethel, making a little face.
      "Isn't it splendid about Larry Gwynne getting the Proficiency, and the
      first in Engineering? Now he is what I call a sport. Of course he doesn't
      go in for games much, but he's into everything, the Lit., the Dramatic
      Society, and Scuddy says he helped him tremendously with the Senior class
      in the Y. M. C. A. work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Jane, "and the Register told Papa that the University had
      never graduated such a brilliant student. And Ramsay Dunn told me that he
      just ran the Athletic Association and was really responsible for the
      winning of the track team."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity about Ramsay Dunn," said Ethel. "He just managed to scrape
      through. Do you know, the boys say he kept himself up mostly on
      whiskey-and-sodas through the exams. He must be awfully clever, and he is
      so good-looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Ramsay," said Jane, "he has not had a very good chance. I mean, he
      has too much money. He is coming to dinner to-night, Ethel, and Frank
      Smart, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Frank Smart! They say he is doing awfully well. Father says he is one
      of the coming men in his profession. He is a great friend of yours, isn't
      he, Jane?" said Ethel, with a meaning smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have known him a long time," said Jane, ignoring the smile. "We think
      a great deal of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When have you seen Larry?" enquired Ethel. "He comes here a lot, doesn't
      he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He says this is his Winnipeg home. I haven't seen him all to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to tell me!" exclaimed Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean I haven't seen him to congratulate him on his medal. His mother
      will be so glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know his people, don't you? Tell me about them. You see, I may as
      well confess to you that I have a fearful crush on Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Jane sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued Ethel, "he is awfully difficult. His people are ranching,
      aren't they? And poor, I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they are ranching," said Jane, "and Larry has had quite a hard time
      getting through. I had a lovely visit last fall with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, tell me about it!" exclaimed Ethel. "I heard a little, you know, from
      Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour Jane dilated on her western visit to the Lakeside Farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you lucky girl!" cried Ethel. "What a chance you had! To think of it!
      Three weeks, lonely rides, moonlight, and not a soul to butt in! Oh, Jane!
      I only wish I had had such a chance! Did nothing happen, Jane? Oh, come on
      now, you are too awfully oysteresque. Didn't he come across at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's face glowed a dull red, but she made no pretence of failing to
      understand Ethel's meaning. "Oh, there is no nonsense of that kind with
      Larry," she said. "We are just good friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good friends!" exclaimed Ethel indignantly. "That's just where he is so
      awfully maddening. I can't understand him. He has lots of red blood, and
      he is a sport, too. But somehow he never knows a girl from her brother. He
      treats me just the way he treats Bruce and Leslie. I often wonder what he
      would do if I kissed him. I've tried squeezing his hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you?" said Jane, with a delighted laugh. "What did he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he never knew it. I could have killed him," said Ethel in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is going away to Chicago," said Jane abruptly, "to your friends, the
      Wakehams. Mr. Wakeham is in mines, as you know. Larry is to get two
      thousand dollars to begin with. It is a good position, and I am glad for
      him. Oh, there I see Mr. MacLean and Frank Smart coming in."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the party had settled down they discussed the Class lists and prize
      winners till Dr. Brown appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we have dinner soon, Jane?" he said as she welcomed him. "I wish to
      get through with my work early so as to take in the big political meeting
      this evening. Mr. Allen is to speak and there is sure to be a crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have it served at once, Papa. Larry is coming, but we won't wait
      for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were half through dinner before Larry appeared. He came in looking
      worn, pale and thinner even than usual. But there was a gleam in his eye
      and an energy in his movements that indicated sound and vigorous health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not late, Larry," said Jane; "we are early. Papa is going to the
      political meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" cried Larry. "So am I. You are going, Frank, and you, MacLean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know yet," said MacLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all due at Mrs. Allen's, Larry, you remember. It is a party for
      the Graduating Class, too," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we are. But we can take in the political meeting first, eh, Mac?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But MacLean glanced doubtfully at Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just had a go with Holtzman," said Larry, "the German Socialist,
      you know. He was ramping and raging like a wild man down in front of the
      post office. I know him quite well. He is going to heckle Mr. Allen
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls were keen to take in the political meeting, but Larry objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a rough time, likely. It will be no place for ladies. We
      will take you to the party, then join you again after the meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls were indignant and appealed to Dr. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said he, "perhaps you had better not go. The young gentlemen
      can join you later, you know, at Allens' party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we don't want them then," said Ethel, "and, indeed, we can go by
      ourselves to the party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Ethel, don't be naughty," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very glad to take you to the party, Miss Murray," said
      MacLean. "I don't care so much for the meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be fine, Mac!" exclaimed Larry enthusiastically. "In this way
      neither they nor we will need to hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgustingly selfish creature," said Ethel, making a face at him across
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane said nothing, but her face fell into firmer lines and her cheeks took
      on a little colour. The dinner was cut short in order to allow Dr. Brown
      to get through with his list of waiting patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have a few minutes, Ethel," said Larry. "Won't you give us a little
      Chopin, a nocturne or two, or a bit of Grieg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, Ethel," said Jane, "although you don't deserve it, Larry. Not a bit,"
      she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what have I done?" said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one thing," said Jane, in a low, hurried voice, moving close to him,
      "you have not given me a chance to congratulate you on your medal. Where
      have you been all day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reproach in her eyes and voice stirred Larry to quick defence. "I have
      been awfully busy, Jane," he said, "getting ready to go off to-morrow. I
      got a telegram calling me to Chicago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Chicago? To-morrow?" said Jane, her eyes wide open with surprise. "And
      you never came to tell me&mdash;to tell us? Why, we may never see you
      again at all. But you don't care a bit, Larry," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitterness in her voice was so unusual with Jane that Larry in his
      astonishment found himself without reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Ethel," she said, "I must see Ann a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she hurried from the room Larry thought he caught a glint of tears in
      her eyes. He was immediately conscience-stricken and acutely aware that he
      had not treated Jane with the consideration that their long and unique
      friendship demanded. True, he had been busy, but he could have found time
      for a few minutes with her. Jane was no ordinary friend. He had not
      considered her and this had deeply wounded her. And to-morrow he was going
      away, and going away not to return. He was surprised at the quick stab of
      pain that came with the thought that his days in Winnipeg were over. In
      all likelihood his life's work would take him to Alberta. This meant that
      when he left Winnipeg tomorrow there would be an end to all that
      delightful comradeship with Jane which during the years of his long and
      broken college course had formed so large a part of his life, and which
      during the past winter had been closer and dearer than ever. Their lives
      would necessarily drift apart. Other friends would come in and preoccupy
      her mind and heart. Jane had the art of making friends and of "binding her
      friends to her with hooks of steel." He had been indulging the opinion
      that of all her friends he stood first with her. Even if he were right, he
      could not expect that this would continue. And now on their last evening
      together, through his selfish stupidity, he had hurt her as never in all
      the years they had been friends together. But Jane was a sensible girl. He
      would make that right at once. She was the one girl he knew that he could
      treat with perfect frankness. Most girls were afraid, either that you were
      about to fall in love with them, or that you would not. Neither one fear
      nor the other disturbed the serenity of Jane's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jane re-entered the room, Larry sprang to meet her. "Jane," he said in
      a low, eager tone, "I am going to take you to the party."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane was her own serene self again, and made answer, "There is no
      need, Larry. Mr. MacLean will see us safely there, and after the meeting
      you will come. We must go now, Ethel." There was no bitterness in her
      voice. Instead, there was about her an air of gentle self-mastery, remote
      alike from pain and passion, that gave Larry the feeling that the comfort
      he had thought to bring was so completely unnecessary as to seem an
      impertinence. Jane walked across to where Frank Smart was standing and
      engaged him in an animated conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Larry watched her, it gave him a quick sharp pang to remember that
      Frank Smart was a friend of older standing than he, that Smart was a
      rising young lawyer with a brilliant future before him. He was a constant
      visitor at this house. Why was it? Like a flash the thing stood revealed
      to him. Without a doubt Smart was in love with Jane. His own heart went
      cold at the thought. But why? he impatiently asked himself. He was not in
      love with Jane. Of that he was quite certain. Why, then, this
      dog-in-the-manger feeling? A satisfactory answer to this was beyond him.
      One thing only stood out before his mind with startling clarity, if Jane
      should give herself to Frank Smart, or, indeed, to any other, then for him
      life would be emptied of one of its greatest joys. He threw down the music
      book whose leaves he had been idly turning and, looking at his watch,
      called out, "Do you know it is after eight o'clock, people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Ethel," said Jane, "we must go. And you boys will have to hurry.
      Larry, don't wait for Papa. He will likely have a seat on the platform.
      Good night for the present. You can find your way out, can't you? And, Mr.
      MacLean, you will find something to do until we come down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling over her shoulder, Jane took Ethel off with her upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Smart, let's get a move on," said Larry, abruptly seizing his hat
      and making for the door. "We will have to fight to get in now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatre was packed, pit to gods. Larry and his friend with
      considerable difficulty made their way to the front row of those standing,
      where they found a group of University men, who gave them enthusiastic
      welcome to a place in their company. The Chairman had made his opening
      remarks, and the first speaker, the Honourable B. B. Bomberton, was well
      on into his oration by the time they arrived. He was at the moment engaged
      in dilating upon the peril through which the country had recently passed,
      and thanking God that Canada had loyally stood by the Empire and had
      refused to sell her heritage for a mess of pottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot!" cried a voice from the first gallery, followed by cheers and
      counter cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable gentleman, however, was an old campaigner and not easily
      thrown out of his stride. He fiercely turned upon his interrupter and
      impaled him upon the spear point of his scornful sarcasm, waving the while
      with redoubled vigour, "the grand old flag that for a thousand years had
      led the embattled hosts of freedom in their fight for human rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot!" cried the same voice again. "Can the flag stuff. Get busy and say
      something." (Cheers, counter cheers, yells of "Throw him out," followed by
      disturbance in the gallery.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the speaker resumed his oration. He repeated his statement that
      the country had been delivered from a great peril. The strain upon the
      people's loyalty had been severe, but the bonds that bound them to the
      Empire had held fast, and please God would ever hold fast. (Enthusiastic
      demonstration from all the audience, indicating intense loyalty to the
      Empire.) They had been invited to enter into a treaty for reciprocal trade
      with the Republic south of us. He would yield to none in admiration, even
      affection, for their American neighbours. He knew them well; many of his
      warmest friends were citizens of that great Republic. But great as was his
      esteem for that Republic he was not prepared to hand over his country to
      any other people, even his American neighbours, to be exploited and
      finally to be led into financial bondage. He proceeded further to
      elaborate and illustrate the financial calamity that would overtake the
      Dominion of Canada as a result of the establishment of Reciprocity between
      the Dominion and the Republic. But there was more than that. They all knew
      that ancient political maxim "Trade follows the flag." But like most
      proverbs it was only half a truth. The other half was equally true that
      "The flag followed trade." There was an example of that within their own
      Empire. No nation in the world had a prouder record for loyalty than
      Scotland. Yet in 1706 Scotland was induced to surrender her independence
      as a nation and to enter into union with England. Why? Chiefly for the
      sake of trade advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye're a dom leear," shouted an excited Scot, rising to his feet in the
      back of the hall. "It was no Scotland that surrendered. Didna Scotland's
      king sit on England's throne. Speak the truth, mon." (Cheers, uproarious
      laughter and cries, "Go to it, Scotty; down wi' the Sassenach. Scotland
      forever!")
    </p>
    <p>
      When peace had once more fallen the Honourable B. B. Bomberton went on. He
      wished to say that his Scottish friend had misunderstood him. He was not a
      Scot himself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye needna tell us that," said the Scot. (Renewed cheers and laughter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would say that the best three-quarters of him was Scotch in that he
      had a Scotch woman for a wife, and nothing that he had said or could say
      could be interpreted as casting a slur upon that great and proud and noble
      race than whom none had taken a larger and more honourable part in the
      building and the maintaining of the Empire. But to resume. The country was
      asked for the sake of the alleged economic advantage to enter into a
      treaty with the neighbouring state which he was convinced would perhaps
      not at first but certainly eventually imperil the Imperial bond. The
      country rejected the proposal. The farmers were offered the double lure of
      high prices for their produce and a lower price for machinery. Never was
      he so proud of the farmers of his country as when they resisted the lure,
      they refused the bait, they could not be bought, they declined to barter
      either their independence or their imperial allegiance for gain. (Cheers,
      groans, general uproar.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the subsidence of the uproar Frank Smart who, with Larry, had worked
      his way forward among a body of students standing in the first row
      immediately behind the seats, raised his hand and called out in a clear,
      distinct and courteous voice, "Mr. Chairman, a question if you will permit
      me." The chairman granted permission. "Did I understand the speaker to say
      that those Canadians who approved of the policy of Reciprocity were ready
      to barter their independence or their imperial allegiance for gain? If so,
      in the name of one half of the Canadian people I want to brand the
      statement as an infamous and slanderous falsehood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a thousand people were on their feet cheering, yelling, on the
      one part shouting, "Put him out," and on the other demanding, "Withdraw."
      A half dozen fights started up in different parts of the theatre. In
      Smart's immediate vicinity a huge, pugilistic individual rushed toward him
      and reached for him with a swinging blow, which would undoubtedly have
      ended for him the meeting then and there had not Larry, who was at his
      side, caught the swinging arm with an upward cut so that it missed its
      mark. Before the blow could be repeated Scudamore, the centre rush of the
      University football team, had flung himself upon the pugilist, seized him
      by the throat and thrust him back and back through the crowd, supported by
      a wedge of his fellow students, striking, scragging, fighting and all
      yelling the while with cheerful vociferousness. By the efforts of mutual
      friends the two parties were torn asunder just as a policeman thrust
      himself through the crowd and demanded to know the cause of the uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," he cried, seizing Larry by the shoulder, "what does this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask me," said Larry, smiling pleasantly at him. "Ask that fighting
      man over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were fighting. I saw you," insisted the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you?" said Larry. "I am rather pleased to hear you say it, but I knew
      nothing of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Sergeant," shouted Smart above the uproar. "Oh, it's you, Mac.
      You know me. You've got the wrong man. There's the man that started this
      thing. He deliberately attacked me. Arrest him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately there were clamorous counter charges and demands for arrest of
      Smart and his student crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now," said Sergeant Mac, "keep quiet, or I'll be takin' ye all into
      the coop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Order once more being restored, the speaker resumed by repudiating
      indignantly the accusation of his young friend. Far be it from him to
      impugn the loyalty of the great Liberal party, but he was bound to say
      that while the Liberals might be themselves loyal both to the Dominion and
      to the Empire, their policy was disastrous. They were sound enough in
      their hearts but their heads were weak. After some further remarks upon
      the fiscal issues between the two great political parties and after a
      final wave of the imperial flag, the speaker declared that he now proposed
      to leave the rest of the time to their distinguished fellow citizen, the
      Honourable J. J. Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allen found himself facing an audience highly inflamed with passion
      and alert for trouble. In a courteous and pleasing introduction he strove
      to allay their excited feelings and to win for himself a hearing. The
      matter which he proposed to bring to their attention was one of the very
      greatest importance, and one which called for calm and deliberate
      consideration. He only asked a hearing for some facts which every Canadian
      ought to know and for some arguments based thereupon which they might
      receive or reject according as they appealed to them or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are all right, Jim; go to it," cried an enthusiastic admirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smile Mr. Allen thanked his friend for the invitation and assured
      him that without loss of time he would accept it. He begged to announce
      his theme: "The Imperative and Pressing Duty of Canada to Prepare to do
      Her Part in Defence of the Empire." He was prepared frankly and without
      hesitation to make the assertion that war was very near the world and very
      near our Empire and for the reason that the great military power of
      Europe, the greatest military power the world had ever seen&mdash;Germany&mdash;purposed
      to make war, was ready for war, and was waiting only a favourable
      opportunity to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, r-r-rats-s," exclaimed a harsh voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Holtzman," said Larry to Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Cries of "Shut up!&mdash;Go on.")
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg the gentleman who has so courteously interrupted me," continued Mr.
      Allen, "simply to wait for my facts." ("Hear! Hear!" from many parts of
      the building.) The sources of his information were three: first, his own
      observation during a three months' tour in Germany; second, his
      conversations with representative men in Great Britain, France and
      Germany; and third, the experience of a young and brilliant attache of the
      British Embassy at Berlin now living in Canada, with whom he had been
      brought into touch by a young University student at present in this city.
      From this latter source he had also obtained possession of literature
      accessible only to a few. He spoke with a full sense of responsibility and
      with a full appreciation of the value of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between the Honourable Mr. Allen and the speaker that
      preceded him was such that the audience was not only willing but eager to
      hear the facts and arguments which the speaker claimed to be in a position
      to offer. Under the first head he gave in detail the story of his visit to
      Germany and piled up an amazing accumulation of facts illustrative of
      Germany's military and naval preparations in the way of land and sea
      forces, munitions and munition factories, railroad construction, food
      supplies and financial arrangements in the way of gold reserves and loans.
      The preparations for war which, in the world's history, had been made by
      Great Powers threatening the world's freedom, were as child's play to
      these preparations now made by Germany, and these which he had given were
      but a few illustrations of Germany's war preparations, for the more
      important of these were kept hidden by her from the rest of the world. "My
      argument is that preparation by a nation whose commercial and economic
      instincts are so strong as those of the German people can only reasonably
      be interpreted to mean a Purpose to War. That that purpose exists and that
      that purpose determines Germany's world's politics, I have learned from
      many prominent Germans, military and naval officers, professors, bankers,
      preachers. And more than that this same purpose can be discovered in the
      works of many distinguished German writers during the last twenty-five
      years. You see this pile of books beside me? They are filled, with open
      and avowed declarations of this purpose. The raison d'etre of the great
      Pan-German League, of the powerful Navy League with one million and a half
      members, and of the other great German organisations is war. Bear with me
      while I read to you extracts from some of these writings. I respectfully
      ask a patient hearing. I would not did I not feel it to be important that
      from representative Germans themselves you should learn the dominating
      purpose that has directed and determined the course of German activity in
      every department of its national life for the last quarter of a century."
    </p>
    <p>
      For almost half an hour the speaker read extracts from the pile of books
      on the table beside him. "I think I may now fairly claim to have
      established first the fact of vast preparations by Germany for war and the
      further fact that Germany cherishes in her heart a settled Purpose of
      War." It was interesting to know how this purpose had come to be so firmly
      established in the heart of a people whom we had always considered to be
      devoted to the cultivation of the gentler arts of peace. The history of
      the rise and the development of this Purpose to War would be found in the
      history of Germany itself. He then briefly touched upon the outstanding
      features in the history of the German Empire from the days of the great
      Elector of Brandenburg to the present time. During these last three
      hundred years, while the English people were steadily fighting for and
      winning their rights to freedom and self-government from tyrant kings, in
      Prussia two powers were being steadily built up, namely autocracy and
      militarism, till under Bismarck and after the War of 1870 these two powers
      were firmly established in the very fibre of the new modern German Empire.
      Since the days of Bismarck the autocrat of Germany had claimed the
      hegemony of Europe and had dreamed of winning for himself and his Empire a
      supreme place among the nations of the world. And this dream he had taught
      his people to share with him, for to them it meant not simply greater
      national glory, which had become a mania with them, but expansion of trade
      and larger commercial returns. And for the realisation of this dream, the
      German Kaiser and his people with him were ready and were waiting the
      opportunity to plunge the world into the bloodiest war of all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some length the speaker proceeded to develop the idea of the necessary
      connection between autocracy and militarism, and the relation of
      autocratic and military power to wars of conquest. "The German Kaiser," he
      continued, "is ready for war as no would-be world conqueror in the world's
      history has ever been ready. The German Kaiser cherishes the purpose to
      make war, and this purpose is shared in and approved by the whole body of
      the German people." These facts he challenged any one to controvert. If
      these things were so, what should Canada do? Manifestly one thing only&mdash;she
      should prepare to do her duty in defending herself and the great Empire.
      "So far," he continued, "I have raised no controversial points. I have
      purposely abstained from dealing with questions that may be regarded from
      a partisan point of view. I beg now to refer to a subject which unhappily
      has become a matter of controversy in Canada&mdash;the subject, namely, of
      the construction of a Canadian Navy. [Disturbance in various parts of the
      building.] You have been patient. I earnestly ask you to be patient for a
      few moments longer. Both political parties fortunately are agreed upon two
      points; first, that Canada must do its share and is willing to do its
      share in the defence of the Empire. On this point all Canadians are at
      one, all Canadians are fully determined to do their full duty to the
      Empire which has protected Canada during its whole history, and with which
      it is every loyal Canadian's earnest desire to maintain political
      connection. Second, Canada must have a Navy. Unfortunately, while we agree
      upon these two points, there are two points upon which we differ. First,
      we differ upon the method to be adopted in constructing our Navy and,
      second, upon the question of Navy control in war. In regard to the second
      point, I would only say that I should be content to leave the settlement
      of that question to the event. When war comes that question will speedily
      be settled, and settled, I am convinced, in a way consistent with what we
      all desire to preserve, Canadian autonomy. In regard to the first, I would
      be willing to accept any method of construction that promised efficiency
      and speed, and with all my power I oppose any method that necessitates
      delay. Considerations of such questions as location of dockyards, the type
      of ship, the size of ship, I contend, are altogether secondary. The main
      consideration is speed. I leave these facts and arguments with you, and
      speaking not as a party politician but simply as a loyal Canadian and as a
      loyal son of the Empire, I would say, 'In God's name, for our country's
      honour and for the sake of our Empire's existence, let us with our whole
      energy and with all haste prepare for war.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence that greeted the conclusion of this address gave eloquent
      proof of the profound impression produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the chairman rose to close the meeting the audience received a shock.
      The raucous voice of Holtzman was heard again demanding the privilege of
      asking two questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first question I would ask, Mr. Chairman, is this: Is not this
      immense war preparation of Germany explicable on the theory of the purpose
      of defence? Mr. Allen knows well that both on the eastern and southern
      frontiers Germany is threatened by the aggression of the Pan-Slavic
      movement, and to protect herself from this Pan-Slavic movement, together
      with a possible French alliance, the war preparations of Germany are none
      too vast. Besides, I would ask Mr. Allen, What about Britain's vast navy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The answer to this question," said Mr. Allen, "is quite simple. What
      nation has threatened Germany for the past forty years? On the contrary,
      every one knows that since 1875 five separate times has Germany threatened
      war against France and twice against Russia. Furthermore military experts
      assure us that in defensive war an army equipped with modern weapons can
      hold off from four to eight times its own strength. It is absurd to say
      that Germany's military preparations are purely defensive. As for
      Britain's navy, the answer is equally simple. Britain's Empire is like no
      other Empire in the world in that it lies spread out upon the seven seas.
      It is essential to her very life that she be able to keep these waterways
      open to her ships. Otherwise she exists solely upon the sufferance of any
      nation that can wrest from her the supremacy of the sea. At her will
      Germany has the right to close against all the world the highways of her
      empire; the highways of Britain's empire are the open seas which she
      shares with the other nations of the world and which she cannot close.
      Therefore, these highways she must be able to make safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Mr. Allen imagines that this answer of his will satisfy any but the
      most bigoted Britain, I am content. Another question I would ask. Does not
      Mr. Allen think that if the capitalistic classes, who leave their burdens
      to be borne by the unhappy proletariat, were abolished wars would
      immediately cease? Does he not know that recently it was proved in Germany
      that the Krupps were found to be promoting war scares in France in the
      interests of their own infernal trade? And lastly does not history prove
      that Britain is the great robber nation of the world? And does he not
      think that it is time she was driven from her high place by a nation which
      is her superior, commercially, socially, intellectually and every other
      way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As if by a preconcerted signal it seemed as if the whole top gallery broke
      into a pandemonium of approving yells, while through other parts of the
      house arose fierce shouts, "Throw him out." Mr. Allen rose and stood
      quietly waiting till the tumult had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the gentleman wishes to engage me in a discussion on socialism, my
      answer is that this is not the time nor place for such a discussion. The
      question which I have been considering is one much too grave to be mixed
      up with an academic discussion of any socialistic theories."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha! Aha!" laughed Holtzman scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for Britain's history, that stands for all the world to read. All the
      nations have been guilty of crimes; but let me say that any one who knows
      the history of Germany for the last three hundred years is aware that in
      unscrupulous aggression upon weaker neighbours, in treachery to friend and
      foe, Germany is the equal of any nation in the world. But if you consider
      her history since 1864 Germany stands in shameless and solitary
      pre-eminence above any nation that has ever been for unscrupulous greed,
      for brutal, ruthless oppression of smaller peoples, and for cynical
      disregard of treaty covenants, as witness Poland, Austria, Denmark,
      Holland and France. As to the treachery of the Krupps, I believe the
      gentleman is quite right, but I would remind him that the Kaiser has no
      better friend to-day than Bertha Krupp, and she is a German."
    </p>
    <p>
      From every part of the theatre rose one mighty yell of delight and
      derision, during which Holtzman stood wildly gesticulating and shouting
      till a hand was seen to reach his collar and he disappeared from view.
      Once more order was restored and the chairman on the point of closing the
      meeting, when Larry said to his friend Smart:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should dearly love to take a hand in this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jump in," said Smart, and Larry "jumped in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Chairman," he said quietly, "may I ask Mr. Allen a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the chairman in curt reply. "The hour is late and I think
      further discussion at present is unprofitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      But here Mr. Allen interposed. "I hope, Mr. Chairman," he said, "you will
      allow my young friend, Mr. Gwynne, of whose brilliant achievements in our
      University we are all so proud, to ask his question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the chairman in no good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to thank Mr. Allen for his courtesy," said Larry. "Further I
      wish to say that though by birth, by training, and by conviction I am a
      pacifist and totally opposed to war, yet to-night I have been profoundly
      impressed by the imposing array of facts presented by the speaker and by
      the arguments built upon these facts, and especially by the fine patriotic
      appeal with which Mr. Allen closed his address. But I am not satisfied,
      and my question is this&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will not Mr. Gwynne come to the platform?" said Mr. Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Larry, "I prefer to stay where I am, I am much too shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cries of "Platform! Platform!" however, rose on every side, to which Larry
      finally yielded, and encouraged by the cheers of his fellow students and
      of his other friends in the audience, he climbed upon the platform. His
      slight, graceful form, the look of intellectual strength upon his pale
      face, his modest bearing, his humorous smile won sympathy even from those
      who were impatient at the prolonging of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Chairman," he began with an exaggerated look of fear upon his face,
      "I confess I am terrified by the position in which I find myself, and were
      it not that I feel deeply the immense importance of this question and the
      gravity of the appeal with which the speaker closed his address, I would
      not have ventured to say a word. My first question is this: Does not Mr.
      Allen greatly exaggerate the danger of war with Germany? And my reasons
      for this question are these. Every one knows that the relations between
      Great Britain and Germany have been steadily improving during the last two
      or three years. I note in this connection a statement made only a few
      months ago by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Winston Churchill. It
      reads as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Germans are a nation with robust minds and a high sense of honour
      and fair play. They look at affairs in a practical military spirit. They
      like to have facts put squarely before them. They do not want them wrapped
      up lest they should be shocked by them, and relations between the two
      countries have steadily improved during the past year. They have steadily
      improved side by side with every evidence of our determination to maintain
      our naval supremacy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "These words spoken in the British House of Commons give us Mr. Winston
      Churchill's deliberate judgment as to the relations between Germany and
      Great Britain. Further Mr. Allen knows that during the past two years
      various peace delegations composed of people of the highest standing in
      each country have exchanged visits. I understand from private
      correspondence from those who have promoted these delegations that the
      last British delegation was received in Germany with the utmost enthusiasm
      by men of all ranks and professions, generals, admirals, burgomasters,
      professors and by the Kaiser himself, all professing devotion to the cause
      of peace and all wishing the delegation Godspeed. Surely these are
      indications that the danger of war is passing away. You, Sir, have made an
      appeal for war preparation tonight, a great and solemn appeal and a moving
      appeal for war&mdash;merciful God, for war! I have been reading about war
      during the past three months, I have been reading again Zola's Debacle&mdash;a
      great appeal for preparedness, you would say. Yes, but a terrific picture
      of the woes of war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry paused. A great silence had fallen upon the people. There flashed
      across his mind as he spoke a vision of war's red, reeking way across the
      fair land of France. In a low but far-penetrating voice, thrilling with
      the agonies which were spread out before him in vision, he pictured the
      battlefield with its mad blood lust, the fury of men against men with whom
      they had no quarrel, the mangled ruins of human remains in dressing
      station and hospital, the white-faced, wild-eyed women waiting at home,
      and back of all, safe, snug and cynical, the selfish, ambitious promoters
      of war. Steady as a marching column without pause or falter, in a tone
      monotonous yet thrilling with a certain subdued passion, he gave forth his
      indictment of war. He was on familiar ground for this had been the theme
      of his prize essay last winter. But to-night the thing to him was vital,
      terrifying, horrible. He was delivering no set address, but with all the
      power of his soul he was pleading for comrades and friends, for wives and
      sweethearts, for little babes and for white-haired mothers, "and in the
      face of all this, you are asking us to prepare that we Canadians, peaceful
      and peace-loving, should do our share to perpetrate this unspeakable
      outrage upon our fellow men, this insolent affront against Almighty God.
      Tell me, if Canada, if Britain, were to expend one-tenth, one-hundredth
      part of the energy, skill, wealth, in promoting peace which they spend on
      war, do you not think we might have a surer hope of warding off from our
      Canadian homes this unspeakable horror?" With white face and flaming eyes,
      his form tense and quivering, he stood facing the advocate of war. For
      some moments, during which men seemed scarcely to breathe, the two faced
      each other. Then in a voice that rang throughout the theatre as it had not
      in all his previous speech, but vibrant with sad and passionate
      conviction, Mr. Allen made reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to ward off from our people and from our Canadian homes this
      calamity that you have so vividly pictured for us that I have made my
      appeal to-night. Your enemy who seeks your destruction will be more likely
      to halt in his spring if you cover him with your gun than if you appeal to
      him with empty hands. For this reason, it is that once more I appeal to my
      fellow Canadians in God's name, in the name of all that we hold dear, let
      us with all our power and with all speed prepare for war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God Save the King," said the Chairman. And not since the thrilling days
      of Mafeking had Winnipeg people sung that quaint archaic, but moving
      anthem as they sang it that night.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CLOSING OF THE DOOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      From the remarks of his friends even as they thronged him, offering
      congratulations, Mr. Allen could easily gather that however impressive his
      speech had been, few of his audience had taken his warning seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You queered my speech, Larry," he said, "but I forgive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, Sir," replied Larry. "You certainly got me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear," replied Mr. Allen, "that I am 'the voice crying in the
      wilderness.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Allens' party Larry was overwhelmed with congratulations on his
      speech, the report of which had been carried before him by his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me your speech was quite thrilling," said Mrs. Allen as she
      greeted Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband is responsible for everything," replied Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mr. Allen, "Miss Jane here is finally responsible. Hers were
      the big shells I fired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not mine," replied Jane. "I got them from Mr. Romayne, your
      brother-in-law, Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm blowed!" said Larry. "That's where the stuff came from! But it
      was mighty effective, and certainly you put it to us, Mr. Allen. You made
      us all feel like fighting. Even Scuddy, there, ran amuck for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Mr. Allen, "you don't really mean to say that Scudamore, our
      genial Y. M. C. A. Secretary, was in that scrap? That cheers me greatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he!" said Ramsay Dunn, whose flushed face and preternaturally grave
      demeanour sufficiently explained his failure to appear at Dr. Brown's
      dinner. "While Mr. Smart's life was saved by the timely upper-cut of our
      distinguished pacifist, Mr. Gwynne, without a doubt Mr. Scudamore&mdash;hold
      him there, Scallons, while I adequately depict his achievement&mdash;"
      Immediately Scallons and Ted Tuttle, Scudamore's right and left supports
      on the scrimmage line, seized him and held him fast. "As I was saying,"
      continued Dunn, "great as were the services rendered to the cause by our
      distinguished pacifist, Mr. Gwynne, the supreme glory must linger round
      the head of our centre scrim and Y. M. C. A. Secretary, Mr. Scudamore, to
      whose effective intervention both Mr. Smart and Mr. Gwynne owe the
      soundness of their physical condition which we see them enjoying at the
      present moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his flowing periods Dunn paused abruptly and turned away.
      He had caught sight of Jane's face, grieved and shocked, in the group
      about him. Later he approached her with every appearance of profound
      humiliation. "Miss Brown," he said, "I must apologise for not appearing at
      dinner this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Dunn," said Jane, "why will you do it? Why break the hearts of
      all your friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Because I am a fool," he said bitterly. "If I had more friends like
      you, Miss Brown," he paused abruptly, then burst forth, "Jane, you always
      make me feel like a beast." But Larry's approach cut short any further
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, I want to talk to you," said Larry impetuously. "Let us get away
      somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the library they found a quiet spot, where they sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to tell you," said Larry, "that I feel that I treated you shabbily
      to-day. I have only a poor excuse to offer, but I should like to explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Larry," said Jane, her words coming with hurried impetuosity. "I
      was very silly. I had quite forgotten it. You know we have always told
      each other things, and I expected that you would come in this morning just
      to talk over your medal, and I did want a chance to say how glad I was for
      you, and how glad and how proud I knew your mother would be; and to tell
      the truth really," she added with a shy little laugh, "I wanted to have
      you congratulate me on my prize too. But, Larry, I understand how you
      forgot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgot!" said Larry. "No, Jane, I did not forget, but this telegram from
      Chicago came last night, and I was busy with my packing all morning and
      then in the afternoon I thought I would hurry through a few calls&mdash;they
      always take longer than one thinks&mdash;and before I knew it I was late
      for dinner. I had not forgotten; I was thinking of you all day, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you, Larry?" said Jane, a gentle tenderness in her smile. "I am
      glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a silence fell between them for some moments. They were both thinking
      of the change that was coming to their lives. Larry was wondering how he
      would ever do without this true-hearted friend whose place in his life he
      was only discovering now to be so large. He glanced at her. Her eyes were
      glowing with a soft radiance that seemed to overflow from some inner
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," he cried with a sudden impulse, "you are lovely, you are perfectly
      lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      A shy, startled, eager look leaped into her eyes. Then her face grew pale.
      She waited, expectant, tremulous. But at that instant a noisy group passed
      into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry," whispered Jane, turning swiftly to him and laying her hand upon
      his arm, "you will take me home to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Jane, of course," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed out from the library Helen Brookes met them. "Larry, come
      here," she said in a voice of suppressed excitement. "Larry, don't you
      want to do something for me? Scuddy wants to take me home tonight, and I
      don't want him to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not, Helen? You ought to be good to Scuddy, poor chap. He's a
      splendid fellow, and I won't have him abused."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-night, Larry; I can't have him to-night. You will take me home,
      won't you? I am going very soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, eh? Well, if you can go within ten minutes, I shall be ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say fifteen," said Helen, turning to meet Lloyd Rushbrook, the Beau
      Brummel of the college, who came claiming a dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry at once went in search of Jane to tell her of his engagement with
      Helen Brookes, but could find her nowhere, and after some time spent in a
      vain search, he left a message for her with his hostess. At the head of
      the stairs he found Helen waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hurry, Larry," she cried in a fever of excitement. "Let's get away
      quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two minutes will do me," said Larry, rushing into the dressing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he found Scudamore pacing up and down in fierce, gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are taking her home, Larry?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" said Larry. Then glancing at his face, he added, "Yes, Scuddy, I am
      taking Helen home. She is apparently in a great hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She need not be; I shall not bother her any more," said Scuddy bitterly,
      "and you can tell her that for me, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't tell her that, Scuddy," said Larry, "and, Scuddy," he added,
      imparting a bit of worldly wisdom, "campaigns are not won in a single
      battle, and, Scuddy, remember too that the whistling fisherman catches the
      fish. So cheer up, old boy." But Scuddy only glowered at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry found Helen awaiting him, and quietly they slipped out together.
      "This is splendid of you, Larry," she said, taking his arm and giving him
      a little squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that, Helen. I left Scuddy raging upstairs there. You
      girls are the very devil for cruelty sometimes. You get men serious with
      you, then you flirt and flutter about till the unhappy wretches don't know
      where they are at. Here's our car."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Car!" exclaimed Helen. "With this moonlight, Larry? And you going away
      to-morrow? Not if I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is fearfully unromantic, Helen, I know. But I must hurry. I have to
      take Jane home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jane! It's always Jane, Jane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not?" said Larry. "For years Jane has been my greatest pal, my
      best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more?" said Helen earnestly. "Cross your heart, Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more, cross my heart and all the rest of it," replied Larry.
      "Why! here's another car, Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry, you are horrid, perfectly heartless! We may never walk
      together again. Here I am throwing myself at you and you only think of
      getting away back." Under her chaffing words there sounded a deeper note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I see," said Larry, laughing and refusing to hear the deeper
      undertone. "But I see something else as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" challenged Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see Scuddy leading out from Trinity some day the loveliest girl in
      Winnipeg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I won't talk about Scuddy," said Helen impatiently. "I want to talk
      about you. Tell me about this Chicago business."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the way home she led Larry to talk of his plans for the
      future. At her door Helen held out her hand. "You won't come in, Larry, I
      know, so we will say good-bye here." Her voice was gentle and earnest. The
      gay, proud, saucy air which she had ever worn and which had been one of
      her chief charms, was gone. The moonlight revealed a lovely wistful face
      from which misty eyes looked into his. "This is the end of our good times
      together, Larry. And we have had good times. You are going to be a great
      man some day. I wish you all the best in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Helen," said Larry, touched by the tones of her voice and the
      look in her eyes. "We have been good friends. We shall never be anything
      else. With my heart I wish you&mdash;oh, just everything that is good,
      Helen dear. Good-bye," he said, leaning toward her. "How lovely you are!"
      he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, dear Larry," she whispered, lifting up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, you dear girl," he said, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now go," she said, pushing him away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be good to Scuddy," he replied as he turned from her and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke into a run, fearing to be late, and by the time he arrived at the
      Allens' door he had forgotten all about Helen Brookes and was thinking
      only of Jane and of what he wanted to say to her. At the inner door he met
      Macleod and Ethel coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane's gone," said Ethel, "some time ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone?" said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Scuddy took her home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they all gone?" inquired Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for the most part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right then; I think I shall not go in. Good-night," he said,
      turned abruptly about and set off for Dr. Brown's. He looked again at his
      watch. He was surprised to find it was not so very late. Why had Jane not
      waited for him? Had he hurt her again? He was sorely disappointed. Surely
      she had no reason to be offended, and this was his last night. As he
      thought the matter over he came to the conclusion that now it was he that
      had a grievance. Arrived at Dr. Brown's house the only light to be seen
      was in Jane's room upstairs. Should he go in or should he go home and wait
      till to-morrow. He was too miserable to think of going home without seeing
      her. He determined that he must see her at all cost to-night. He took a
      pebble and flung it up against her window, and another and another. The
      window opened and Jane appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry," she whispered. "Is it you? Wait, I shall be down."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door for him and stood waiting for him to speak. "Why
      didn't you wait?" he asked, passing into the hall. "I was not very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I wait, Larry?" she said quietly. "Scuddy told me you had gone
      home with Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But didn't I promise that I would take you home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did, and then went away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, all I have to say, Jane, is that this is not a bit like you. I am
      sorry I brought you down, and I won't keep you any longer. Good-night. I
      shall see you tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane got between him and the door and stood with her back to it. "No,
      Larry, you are not going away like that. Go into the study." Larry looked
      at her in astonishment. This was indeed a new Jane to him. Wrathful,
      imperious, she stood waving him toward the study door. In spite of his
      irritation he was conscious of a new admiration for her. Feeling a little
      like a boy about to receive his punishment, he passed into the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't Mrs. Allen give you my message?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your message, Larry?" cried Jane, a light breaking upon her face. "Did
      you leave a message for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. I told Mrs. Allen to tell you where I had gone&mdash;Helen was so
      anxious to go&mdash;and that I would be right back." Larry's voice was
      full of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry, I am so glad," said Jane, her tone indicating the greatness of
      her relief. "I knew it was all right&mdash;that something had prevented. I
      am so glad you came in. You must have thought me queer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Larry, appeased, "I knew all the time there must be some
      explanation, only I was feeling so miserable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I was miserable, too, Larry," she said gently. "It seemed a pity that
      this should happen on our last night." All her wrath was gone. She was
      once more the Jane that Larry had always known, gentle, sweet,
      straightforward, and on her face the old transfiguring smile. Before this
      change of mood all his irritation vanished. Humbled, penitent, and with a
      rush of warm affection filling his heart, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have known you were not to blame, but you are always right.
      Never once in all these years have you failed me. You always understand a
      fellow. Do you know I am wondering how I shall ever do without you? Have
      you thought, Jane, that to-morrow this old life of ours together will
      end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Larry." Her voice was low, almost a whisper, and in her eyes an
      eager light shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It just breaks my heart, Jane. We have been&mdash;we are such good
      friends. If we had only fallen in love with each other.&mdash;But that
      would have spoiled it all. We are not like other people; we have been such
      chums, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Larry," she said again, but the eager light had faded from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's sit a bit, Larry," she said. "I am tired, and you are tired, too,"
      she added quickly, "after your hard day."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little time they sat in silence together, both shrinking from the
      parting that they knew was so near. Larry gazed at her, wondering to
      himself that he had ever thought her plain. Tonight she seemed beautiful
      and very dear to him. Next to his mother, was her place in his heart. Was
      this that he felt for her what they called love? With all his soul he
      wished he could take her in his arms and say, "Jane, I love you." But
      still he knew that his words would not ring true. More than that, Jane
      would know it too. Besides, might not her feeling for him be of the same
      quality? What could he say in this hour which he recognised to be a crisis
      in their lives? Sick at heart and oppressed with his feeling of loneliness
      and impotence, he could only look at her in speechless misery. Then he
      thought she, too, was suffering, the same misery was filling her heart.
      She looked utterly spent and weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," he said desperately. She started. She, too, had been thinking.
      "Scuddy is in love with Helen, Macleod is in love with Ethel. I wish to
      God I had fallen in love with you and you with me. Then we would have
      something to look forward to. Do you know, Jane, I am like a boy leaving
      home? We are going to drift apart. Others will come between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Larry," cried Jane with quick vehemence. "Not that. You won't let
      that come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can we help it, Jane?" Then her weariness appealed to him. "It is a shame
      to keep you up. I have given you a hard day, Jane." She shook her head.
      "And there is no use waiting. We can only say good-bye." He rose from his
      chair. Should he kiss her, he asked himself. He had had no hesitation in
      kissing Helen an hour ago. That seemed a light thing to him, but somehow
      he shrank from offering to kiss Jane. If he could only say sincerely,
      "Jane, I love you," then he could kiss her, but this he could not say
      truly. Anything but perfect sincerity he knew she would detect; and she
      would be outraged by it. Yet as he stood looking down upon her pale face,
      her wavering smile, her quivering lips, he was conscious of a rush of pity
      and of tenderness almost uncontrollable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Jane; God keep you always, dear, dear Jane." He held her hands,
      looking into the deep blue eyes that looked back at him so bravely. He
      felt that he was fast losing his grip upon himself, and he must hurry
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Larry," she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye," he said again in a husky voice. Abruptly he turned and left
      her and passed out through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sore, sick at heart, he stumbled down the steps. "My God," he cried, "what
      a fool I am! Why didn't I kiss her? I might have done that at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking at the closed door, struggling against an almost
      irresistible impulse to return and take her in his arms. Did he not love
      her? What other was this that filled his heart? Could he honestly say,
      "Jane, I want you for my wife"? He could not. Miserable and cursing
      himself he went his way.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GERMAN TYPE OF CITIZENSHIP
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Dean Wakeham was always glad to have a decent excuse to run up to the
      Lakeside Farm. His duties at the Manor Mine were not so pressing that he
      could not on occasion take leave of absence, but to impose himself upon
      the Lakeside household as frequently as he desired made it necessary for
      him to utilise all possible excuses. In the letter which he held in his
      hand and which he had just read he fancied he had found a perfectly good
      excuse for a call. The letter was from his sister Rowena and was dated May
      15th, 1914. It was upon his sister's letters that he depended for
      information regarding the family life generally and about herself in
      particular. His mother's letters were intimate and personal, reflecting,
      however, various phases of her ailments, her anxieties for each member of
      the family, but especially for her only son now so far from her in that
      wild and uncivilised country, but ever overflowing with tender affection.
      Dean always put down his mother's letters with a smile of gentle pity on
      his face. "Poor, dear Mater," he would say. "She is at rest about me only
      when she has me safely tucked up in my little bed." His father's letters
      kept him in touch with the office and, by an illuminating phrase or two,
      with the questions of Big Business. But when he had finished Rowena's
      letters he always felt as if he had been paying a visit to his home.
      Through her letters his sister had the rare gift of transmitting
      atmosphere. There were certain passages in his letter just received which
      he felt he should at the earliest moment share with the Lakeside Farm
      people, in other words, with Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      His car conveyed him with all speed to Lakeside Farm in good time for the
      evening meal. To the assembled family Dean proceeded to read passages
      which he considered of interest to them. "'Well, your Canadian has really
      settled down into his place in the office and into his own rooms. It was
      all we could do to hold him with us for a month, he is so fearfully
      independent. Are all Canadians like that? The Mater would have been glad
      to have had him remain a month longer. But would he stay? He has a way
      with him. He has struck up a terrific friendship with Hugo Raeder. You
      remember the Yale man who has come to Benedick, Frame and Company,
      father's financial people? Quite a presentable young man he is of the best
      Yale type, which is saying something. Larry and he have tied up to each
      other in quite a touching way. In the office, too, Larry has found his
      place. He captured old Scread the very first day by working out some
      calculations that had been allowed to accumulate, using some method of his
      own which quite paralysed the old chap. Oh, he has a way with him, that
      Canadian boy! Father, too, has fallen for him. To hear him talk you would
      imagine that he fully intended handing over ere long the business to
      Larry's care. The Mater has adopted him as well, but with reservations. Of
      course, what is troubling her is her dread of a Canadian invasion of her
      household, especially&mdash;'um um&mdash;" At this point Mr. Dean Wakeham
      read a portion of the letter to himself with slightly heightened colour.
      "'While as for Elfie, he has captured her, baggage and bones. The little
      monkey apparently lives only for him. While as for Larry, you would think
      that the office and the family were the merest side issues in comparison
      with the kid. All the same it is very beautiful to see them together. At
      times you would think they were the same age and both children. At other
      times she regards him with worshipful eyes and drinks in his words as if
      he were some superior being and she his equal in age and experience. She
      has taken possession of him, and never hesitates to carry him off to her
      own quarters, apparently to his delight. Oh, he has a way with him, that
      Canadian boy! The latest is that he has invited Elfie to stay a month with
      him in Alberta when he gets his first holiday. He has raved to her over
      Polly. Elfie, I believe, has accepted his invitation regardless of the
      wishes of either family. The poor little soul is really better, I believe,
      for his companionship. She is not so fretful and she actually takes her
      medicine without a fight and goes to bed at decent hours upon the merest
      hint of his Lordship's desire in the matter. In short, he has the family
      quite prostrate before him. I alone have been able to stand upright and
      maintain my own individuality.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am really awfully glad about the kid," said Dean. "After all she really
      has rather a hard time. She is so delicate and needs extra care and
      attention, and that, I am afraid, has spoiled her a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't the little girl spend a few weeks with us here this summer,
      Mr. Wakeham?" said Mrs. Gwynne. "Will you not say to your mother that we
      should take good care of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. Gwynne, that is awfully good of you, but I am a little afraid
      you would find her quite a handful. As I have said, she is a spoiled
      little monkey and not easy to do with. She would give you all a lot of
      trouble," added Dean, looking at Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble? Not at all," said Nora. "She could do just as she likes here. We
      would give her Polly and let her roam. And on the farm she would find a
      number of things to interest her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be an awfully good thing for her, I know," said Dean, vainly
      trying to suppress the eagerness in his tone, "and if you are really sure
      that it would not be too much of a burden I might write."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No burden at all, Mr. Wakeham," said Mrs. Gwynne. "If you will write and
      ask Mrs. Wakeham, and bring her with you when you return, we shall do what
      we can to make her visit a happy one, and indeed, it may do the dear child
      a great deal of good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came about that the little city child, delicate, fretted, spoiled,
      was installed in the household at Lakeside Farm for a visit which
      lengthened out far beyond its original limits. The days spent upon the
      farm were full of bliss to her, the only drawback to the perfect happiness
      of the little girl being the separation from her beloved fidus Achates,
      with whom she maintained an epistolary activity extraordinarily intimate
      and vivid. Upon this correspondence the Wakeham family came chiefly to
      depend for enlightenment as to the young lady's activities and state of
      health, and it came to be recognised as part of Larry's duty throughout
      the summer to carry a weekly bulletin regarding Elfie's health and manners
      to the Lake Shore summer home, where the Wakehams sought relief from the
      prostrating heat of the great city. These week ends at the Lake Shore home
      were to Larry his sole and altogether delightful relief from the
      relentless drive of business that even throughout the hottest summer
      weather knew neither let nor pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became custom that every Saturday forenoon Rowena's big car would call
      at the Rookery Building and carry off her father, if he chanced to be in
      town, and Larry to the Lake Shore home. An hour's swift run over the
      perfect macadam of the Lake Shore road that wound through park and
      boulevard, past splendid summer residences of Chicago financial magnates,
      through quiet little villages and by country farms, always with gleams of
      Michigan's blue-grey waters, and always with Michigan's exhilarating
      breezes in their faces, would bring them to the cool depths of Birchwood's
      shades and silences, where for a time the hustle and heat and roar of the
      big city would be as completely forgotten as if a thousand miles away. It
      was early on a breathless afternoon late in July when from pavement and
      wall the quivering air smote the face as if blown from an opened furnace
      that Rowena drove her car down La Salle Street and pulled up at the
      Rookery Building resolved to carry off with her as a special treat "her
      men" for an evening at Birchwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, Larry, it is too hot to live in town today," she said as she
      passed through the outer office where the young man had his desk. "I am
      just going in to get father, so don't keep me waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Wakeham, why will you add to the burdens of the day by breezing thus
      in upon us and making us discontented with our lot. I cannot possibly
      accept your invitation this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Not to-day, with the thermometer at ninety-four? Nonsense!" said
      the young lady brusquely. "You look fit to drop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite useless," said Larry with a sigh. "You see we have a man in
      all the way from Colorado to get plans of a mine which is in process of
      reconstruction. These plans will take hours to finish. The work is
      pressing, in short must be done to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, look here, young man. All work in this office is pressing but none
      so pressing that it cannot pause at my command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this man is due to leave to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I decline to talk about it; it is much too hot. Just close up your
      desk," said the young lady, as she swept on to her father's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time she returned, bearing that gentleman in triumph with her.
      "Not ready?" she said. "Really you are most exasperating, Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may as well throw up your hands, Larry. You'd better knock off for
      the day," said Mr. Wakeham. "It is really too hot to do anything else than
      surrender."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, it is like this, sir," said Larry. "It is that Colorado mine
      reconstruction business. Their manager, Dimock, is here. He must leave, he
      says, tomorrow morning. Mr. Scread thinks he should get these off as soon
      as possible. So it is necessary that I stick to it till we get it done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long will it take?" said Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect to finish to-night some time. I have already had a couple of
      hours with Dimock to-day. He has left me the data."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am very sorry, indeed," said Mr. Wakeham. "It is a great pity you
      cannot come with us, and you look rather fagged. Dimock could not delay,
      eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says he has an appointment at Kansas City which he must keep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is perfect rubbish," exclaimed Rowena impatiently, "and we have a
      party on to-night. Your friend, Mr. Hugh Raeder, is to be out, and
      Professor Schaefer and a friend of his, and some perfectly charming
      girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why tell me these things now, Miss Wakeham," said Larry, "when you
      know it is impossible for me to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along then, father," she said, and with a stiff little bow she left
      Larry at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the car moved off Larry came hurrying out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is Elfie's letter," he said. "Perhaps Mrs. Wakeham would like to see
      it." Miss Wakeham was busy at the wheel and gave no sign of having heard
      or seen. So her father reached over and took the letter from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," said Larry gravely, "I do not think it is quite so hot as
      it was. I almost fancy I feel a chill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A chill?" said Mr. Wakeham anxiously. "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wakeham bit her lip, broke into a smile and then into a laugh. "Oh,
      he's a clever thing, he is," she said. "I hope you may have a real good
      roast this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will call next Saturday," said Larry earnestly. "It is sure to
      be hot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't deserve it or anything else that is good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except your pity. Think what I am missing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get in out of the heat," she cried as the car slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some blocks Miss Wakeham was busy getting her car through the crush of
      the traffic, but as she swung into the Park Road she remarked, "That young
      man takes himself too seriously. You would think the business belonged to
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to God I had more men in my office," said her father, "who thought
      the same thing. Do you know, young lady, why it is that so many greyheads
      are holding clerk's jobs? Because clerks do not feel that the business is
      their own. The careless among them are working for five o'clock, and the
      keen among them are out for number one. Do you know if that boy keeps on
      thinking that the business is his he will own a big slice of it or
      something better before he quits. I confess I was greatly pleased that you
      failed to move him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, he is awfully stubborn," said his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't bully him as you do your old dad, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had counted on him for our dinner party to-night. I particularly want
      to have him meet Professor Schaefer, and now we will have a girl too many.
      It just throws things out."
    </p>
    <p>
      They rolled on in silence for some time through the park when suddenly her
      father said, "He may be finished by six o'clock, and Michael could run in
      for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock Miss Wakeham called Larry on the 'phone. "Are you still at
      it?" she enquired. "And when will you be finished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hour, I think, will see me through," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Miss Wakeham, "a little before seven o'clock the car will be
      waiting at your office door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hooray!" cried Larry. "You are an angel. I will be through."
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter of seven Larry was standing on the pavement, which was still
      radiating heat, and so absorbed in watching for the Wakehams' big car that
      he failed to notice a little Mercer approaching till it drew up at his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, you, Miss Rowena?" he cried. "Your own self? How very lovely of
      you, and through all this heat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me," replied the girl, "only me. I thought it might still be hot and a
      little cool breeze would be acceptable. But jump in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cool breeze, I should say so!" exclaimed Larry. "A lovely, cool, sweet
      spring breeze over crocuses and violets! But, I say, I must go to my room
      for my clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No evening clothes to-night," exclaimed Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but I have a new, lovely, cool suit that I have been hoping to
      display at Birchwood. These old things would hardly do at your dinner
      table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll go around for it. Do get in. Do you know, I left my party to come
      for you, partly because I was rather nasty this afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were indeed," said Larry. "You almost broke my heart, but this wipes
      all out; my heart is singing again. That awfully jolly letter of Elfie's
      this week made me quite homesick for the open and for the breezes of the
      Alberta foothills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what she said," said Rowena, not because she wanted so much to
      hear Elfie's news but because she loved to hear him talk, and upon no
      subject could Larry wax so eloquent as upon the foothill country of
      Alberta. Long after they had secured Larry's new suit and gone on their
      way through park and boulevard, Larry continued to expatiate upon the
      glories of Alberta hills and valleys, upon its cool breezes, its flowing
      rivers and limpid lakes, and always the western rampart of the eternal
      snow-clad peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how is the mine doing?" inquired Rowena, for Larry had fallen silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mine? Oh, there's trouble there, I am afraid. Switzer&mdash;you have
      heard of Switzer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I know all about him and his tragic disappointment. He's the
      manager, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The manager? No, he's the secretary, but in this case it means the same
      thing, for he runs the mine. Well, Switzer wants to sell his stock. He and
      his father hold about twenty-five thousand dollars between them. He means
      to resign. And to make matters worse, the manager left last week. They are
      both pulling out, and it makes it all the worse, for they had just gone in
      for rather important extensions. I am anxious a bit. You see they are
      rather hard up for money, and father raised all he could on his ranch and
      on his mining stock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much is involved?" inquired Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not so much money as you people count it, but for us it is all we
      have. He raised some fifty thousand dollars. While the mine goes on and
      pays it is safe enough, but if the mine quits then it is all up with us.
      There is no reason for anxiety at present as far as the mine is concerned,
      however. It is doing splendidly and promises better every day. But
      Switzer's going will embarrass them terribly. He was a perfect marvel for
      work and he could handle the miners as no one else could. Most of them,
      you know, are his own people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you are worrying," said Rowena, glancing at his face, which she
      thought unusually pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. At least, not very much. Jack is a levelheaded chap&mdash;Jack
      Romayne, I mean&mdash;my brother-in-law. By the way, I had a wire to say
      that young Jack had safely arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Jack? Oh, I understand. Then you are Uncle Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. How ancient I feel! And what a lot of responsibility it lays upon
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope your sister is quite well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything fine, so I am informed. But what was I saying? Oh, yes, Jack
      is a level-headed chap and his brother-in-law, Waring-Gaunt, who is
      treasurer of the company, is very solid. So I think there's no doubt but
      that they will be able to make all necessary arrangements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't worry to-night," said Rowena. "I want you to have a good
      time. I am particularly anxious that you should meet and like Professor
      Schaefer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A German, eh?" said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;that is, a German-American. He is a metallurgist, quite
      wonderful, I believe. He does a lot of work for father, and you will
      doubtless have a good deal to do with him yourself. And he spoke so highly
      of Canada and of Canadians that I felt sure you would be glad to meet him.
      He is really a very charming man, musical and all that, but chiefly he is
      a man of high intelligence and quite at the top of his profession. He
      asked to bring a friend of his with him, a Mr. Meyer, whom I do not know
      at all; but he is sure to be interesting if he is a friend of Professor
      Schaefer's. We have some nice girls, too, so we hope to have an
      interesting evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      The company was sufficiently varied to forbid monotony, and sufficiently
      intellectual to be stimulating, and there was always the background of Big
      Business. Larry was conscious that he was moving amid large ideas and
      far-reaching interests, and that though he himself was a small element, he
      was playing a part not altogether insignificant, with a promise of bigger
      things in the future. Professor Schaefer became easily the centre of
      interest in the party. He turned out to be a man of the world. He knew
      great cities and great men. He was a connoisseur in art and something more
      than an amateur in music. His piano playing, indeed, was far beyond that
      of the amateur. But above everything he was a man of his work. He knew
      metals and their qualities as perhaps few men in America, and he was
      enthusiastic in his devotion to his profession. After dinner, with
      apologies to the ladies, he discoursed from full and accurate knowledge of
      the problems to be met within his daily work and their solutions. He was
      frequently highly technical, but to everything he touched he lent a charm
      that captivated his audience. To Larry he was especially gracious. He was
      interested in Canada. He apparently had a minute knowledge of its mineral
      history, its great deposits in metals, in coal, and oil, which he declared
      to be among the richest in the world. The mining operations, however,
      carried out in Canada, he dismissed as being unworthy of consideration. He
      deplored the lack of scientific knowledge and the absence of organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should do that better in our country. Ah, if only our Government would
      take hold of these deposits," he exclaimed, "the whole world should hear
      of them." The nickel mining industry alone in the Sudbury district he
      considered worthy of respect. Here he became enthusiastic. "If only my
      country had such a magnificent bit of ore!" he cried. "But such bungling,
      such childish trifling with one of the greatest, if not the very greatest,
      mining industries in the world! To think that the Government of Canada
      actually allows the refining of that ore to be done outside of its own
      country! Folly, folly, criminal folly! But it is all the same in this
      country, too. The mining work in America is unscientific, slovenly,
      unorganised, wasteful. I am sorry to say," he continued, turning suddenly
      upon Larry, "in your western coal fields you waste more in the smoke of
      your coke ovens than you make out of your coal mines. Ah, if only those
      wonderful, wonderful coal fields were under the organised and scientific
      direction of my country! Then you would see&mdash;ah, what would you not
      see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your country?" said Hugo Raeder, smiling. "I understood you were an
      American, Professor Schaefer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An American? Surely! I have been eighteen years in this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a citizen, I presume?" said Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A citizen? Yes. I neglected that matter till recently; but I love my
      Fatherland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speaking of citizenship, I have always wanted to know about the Delbruck
      Law, Professor Schaefer, in regard to citizenship," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor hesitated, "The Delbruck Law?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Larry. "How does it affect, for instance, your American
      citizenship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, I should say. Not in the very least," replied Professor
      Schaefer curtly and as if dismissing the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not so sure of that, Professor Schaefer," said Hugo Raeder. "I was
      in Germany when that law was passed. It aroused a great deal of interest.
      I have not looked into it myself, but on the face of it I should say it
      possesses certain rather objectionable features."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, not at all, I assure you," exclaimed Professor Schaefer. "It
      is simply a concession to the intense, but very natural affection for the
      Fatherland in every German heart, while at the same time it facilitates
      citizenship in a foreign country. For instance, there are millions of
      Germans living in America who like myself shrank from taking the oath
      which breaks the bond with the Fatherland. We love America, we are
      Americans, we live in America, we work in America; but naturally our
      hearts turn to Germany, and we cannot forget our childhood's home. That is
      good, that is worthy, that is noble&mdash;hence the Delbruck Law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what does it provide exactly?" enquired Mr. Wakeham. "I confess I
      never heard of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It permits a German to become an American citizen, and at the same time
      allows him to retain his connection, his heart connection, with the
      Fatherland. It is a beautiful law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A beautiful law," echoed his friend, Mr. Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what is the connection?" insisted Hugo Raeder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear friend, let me explain to you. It permits him to retain his place,
      his relations with his own old country people. You can surely see the
      advantage of that. For instance: When I return to Germany I find myself in
      full possession of all my accustomed privileges. I am no stranger. Ah, it
      is beautiful! And you see further how it establishes a new bond between
      the two countries. Every German-American will become a bond of unity
      between these two great nations, the two great coming nations of the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful, beautiful, glorious!" echoed Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do not understand," said Larry. "Are you still a citizen of
      Germany?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am an American citizen, and proud of it," exclaimed Professor Schaefer,
      dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, so, geviss," said Meyer. "Sure! an American citizen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are also a citizen of Germany?" enquired Hugo Raeder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I return to Germany I resume the rights of my German citizenship, of
      course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful, beautiful!" exclaimed Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Schaefer. Be frank about this. Which are you to-day, a citizen
      of Germany or of America?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both, I tell you," exclaimed Schaefer proudly. "That is the beauty of the
      arrangement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, a beautiful arrangement!" said Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? You are a citizen of another country while you claim American
      citizenship?" said Raeder. "You can no more be a citizen of two countries
      at the same time than the husband of two wives at the same time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why not?" laughed Schaefer. "An American wife for America, and a
      German wife for Germany. You will excuse me," he added, bowing toward Mrs.
      Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be disgusting," said Hugo Raeder. "Apart from the legal difficulty
      the chief difficulty about that scheme would be that whatever the German
      wife might have to say to such an arrangement, no American wife would
      tolerate it for an instant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was merely joking, of course," said Schaefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Professor Schaefer, suppose war should come between Germany and
      America," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "War between Germany and America&mdash;the thing is preposterous nonsense,
      not to be considered among the possibilities!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as a mere hypothesis for the sake of argument, what would your
      position be?" persisted Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Schaefer was visibly annoyed. "I say the hypothesis is nonsense
      and unthinkable," he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Schaefer, you can't escape it like that, you know," said Hugo
      Raeder. "By that law of yours, where would your allegiance be should war
      arise? I am asking what actually would be your standing. Would you be a
      German citizen or an American citizen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The possibility does not exist," said Professor Schaefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite impossible," exclaimed Meyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what of other countries then?" said Hugo, pursuing the subject with
      a wicked delight. His sturdy Americanism resented this bigamous
      citizenship. "What of France or Britain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Professor Schaefer with a sharpening of his tone. "That is
      quite easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would be a German, eh?" said Raeder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ask me," exclaimed Professor Schaefer, "you ask me as between Germany
      and France, or between Germany and Britain? I reply," he exclaimed with a
      dramatic flourish of his hand, "I am a worshipper of the life-giving sun,
      not of the dead moon; I follow the dawn, not the dying day."
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was too much for Larry. "Without discussing which is the sun and
      which is the moon, about which we might naturally differ, Professor
      Schaefer, I want to be quite clear upon one point. Do I understand you to
      say that if you were, say a naturalised citizen of Canada, having sworn
      allegiance to our Government, enjoying the full rights and privileges of
      our citizenship, you at the same time would be free to consider yourself a
      citizen of Germany, and in case of war with Britain, you would feel in
      duty bound to support Germany? And is it that which the Delbruck Law is
      deliberately drawn, to permit you to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well put, Larry!" exclaimed Hugo Raeder, to whom the German's attitude
      was detestable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Schaefer's lips curled in an unpleasant smile. "Canada, Canadian
      citizenship! My dear young man, pardon! Allow me to ask you a question. If
      Britain were at war with Germany, do you think it at all likely that
      Canada would allow herself to become involved in a European war? Canada is
      a proud, young, virile nation. Would she be likely to link her fortunes
      with those of a decadent power? Excuse me a moment," checking Larry's
      impetuous reply with his hand. "Believe me, we know something about these
      things. We make it our business to know. You acknowledge that we know
      something about your mines; let me assure you that there is nothing about
      your country that we do not know. Nothing. Nothing. We know the feeling in
      Canada. Where would Canada be in such a war? Not with Germany, I would not
      say that. But would she stand with England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry sprang to his feet. "Where would Canada be? Let me tell you,
      Professor Schaefer," shaking his finger in the professor's face. "To her
      last man and her last dollar Canada would be with the Empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear!" shouted Hugo Raeder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor looked incredulous. "And yet," he said with a sneer,
      "one-half of your people voted for Reciprocity with the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reciprocity! And yet you say you know Canada," exclaimed Larry in a tone
      of disgust. "Do you know, sir, what defeated Reciprocity with this
      country? Not hostility to the United States; there is nothing but the
      kindliest feeling among Canadians for Americans. But I will tell you what
      defeated Reciprocity. It was what we might call the ultra loyal spirit of
      the Canadian people toward the Empire. The Canadians were Empire mad. The
      bare suggestion of the possibility of any peril to the Empire bond made
      them throw out Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberal Party. That, of course,
      with other subordinate causes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy our Mr. Taft helped a bit," said Hugo Raeder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly Mr. Taft's unfortunate remarks were worked to the limit by
      the Conservative Party. But all I say is that any suggestion, I will not
      say of disloyalty, but even of indifference, to the Empire of Canada is
      simply nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point a servant brought in a telegram and handed it to Mr.
      Wakeham. "Excuse me, my dear," he said to his wife, opened the wire, read
      it, and passed it to Hugo Raeder. "From your chief, Hugo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much in that, do you think, sir?" inquired Hugo, passing the telegram
      back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a little flurry in the market possibly," said Mr. Wakeham. "What do
      you think about that, Schaefer?" Mr. Wakeham continued, handing him the
      wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Schaefer glanced at the telegram. "My God!" he exclaimed,
      springing to his feet. "It is come, it is come at last!" He spoke
      hurriedly in German to his friend, Meyer, and handed him the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meyer read it. "God in heaven!" he cried. "It is here!" In intense
      excitement he poured forth a torrent of interrogations in German,
      receiving animated replies from Professor Schaefer. Then grasping the
      professor's hand in both of his, he shook it with wild enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last!" he cried. "At last! Thank God, our day has come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely ignoring the rest of the company, the two Germans carried on a
      rapid and passionate conversation in their own tongue with excited
      gesticulations, which the professor concluded by turning to his hostess
      and saying, "Mrs. Wakeham, you will excuse us. Mr. Wakeham, you can send
      us to town at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the whole company were upon their feet gazing with amazement
      upon the two excited Germans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is it?" cried Mrs. Wakeham. "What has happened? Is there
      anything wrong? What is it, Professor Schaefer? What is your wire about,
      Garrison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing at all, my dear, to get excited about. My financial agent
      wires me that the Press will announce to-morrow that Austria has presented
      an ultimatum to Servia demanding an answer within forty-eight hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is that all," she said in a tone of vast relief. "What a start you
      all gave me. An ultimatum to Servia? What is it all about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you remember, my dear, the murder of the Archduke Ferdinand about
      three weeks ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I remember. I had quite forgotten it. Poor thing, how terrible
      it was! Didn't they get the murderer? It seems to me they caught him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will excuse us, Mrs. Wakeham," said Professor Schaefer, approaching
      her. "We deeply regret leaving this pleasant party and your hospitable
      home, but it is imperative that we go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear Professor Schaefer, to-night?" exclaimed Mrs. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Schaefer, what's the rush? Are you caught in the market?" said
      Wakeham with a little laugh. "You cannot do anything to-night at any rate,
      you know. We will have you in early to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, to-night, now, immediately!" shouted Meyer in uncontrollable
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why all the excitement, Schaefer?" said Hugo Raeder, smiling at him.
      "Austria has presented an ultimatum to Servia&mdash;what about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about it? Oh, you Americans; you are so provincial. Did you read the
      ultimatum? Do you know what it means? It means war!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "War!" cried Meyer. "War at last! Thank God! Tonight must we in New York
      become."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaking hands hurriedly with Mrs. Wakeham, and with a curt bow to the rest
      of the company, Meyer hurriedly left the room, followed by Professor
      Schaefer and Mr. Wakeham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't they funny!" said Rowena. "They get so excited about nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is hardly nothing," said Hugo Raeder. "Any European war is full
      of all sorts of possibilities. You cannot throw matches about in a powder
      magazine without some degree of danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I read the ultimatum?" said Larry to Mrs. Wakeham, who held the
      telegram in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty stiff ultimatum," said Hugo Raeder. "Read it out, Larry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Servia will have to eat dirt," said Larry when he had finished. "Listen
      to this: She must 'accept the collaboration in Servia of representatives
      of the Austro-Hungarian Government for the consideration of the subversive
      movements directed against the Territorial integrity of the Monarchy.'
      'Accept collaboration' of the representatives of the Austro-hungarian
      Government in this purely internal business, mind you. And listen to this:
      'Delegates of the Austro-Hungarian Government will take part in the
      investigation relating thereto.' Austrian lawyers and probably judges
      investigating Servian subjects in Servia? Why, the thing is impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite evident," said Hugo Raeder, "that Austria means war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little Servia, she will soon be eaten up," said Rowena. "She must be
      bankrupt from her last war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why all this excitement on the part of our German friends?" inquired
      Mrs. Wakeham. "What has Germany to do with Austria and Servia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Professor Schaefer and his friend re-entered the room ready
      for their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just inquiring," said Mrs. Wakeham, "how this ultimatum of
      Austria's to Servia can affect Germany particularly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Affect Germany?" cried Professor Schaefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Hugo Raeder, "what has Germany to do with the scrap unless she
      wants to butt in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! My dear man, have you read no history of the last twenty years?
      But you Americans know nothing about history, nothing about anything
      except your own big, overgrown country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were an American citizen, Schaefer?" inquired Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An American," exclaimed Schaefer, "an American, ah, yes, certainly; but
      in Europe and in European politics, a German, always a German."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should Germany butt in?" continued Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Butt in, Germany butt in? Things cannot be settled in Europe without
      Germany. Besides, there is Russia longing for the opportunity to attack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To attack Germany?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To attack Austria first, Germany's ally and friend, and then Germany. The
      trouble is you Americans do not live in the world. You are living on your
      own continent here removed from the big world, ignorant of all world
      movements, the most provincial people in all the world. Else you would not
      ask me such foolish questions. This ultimatum means war. First, Austria
      against Servia; Russia will help Servia; France will help Russia; Germany
      will help Austria. There you have the beginning of a great European war.
      How far this conflagration will spread, only God knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      The car being announced, the Germans made a hurried exit, in their
      overpowering excitement omitting the courtesy of farewells to household
      and guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They seem to be terribly excited, those Germans," said Miss Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are," said Hugo; "I am glad I am not a German. To a German war is so
      much the biggest thing in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really too bad," said Mrs. Wakeham; "we shall not have the pleasure
      of Professor Schaefer's music. He plays quite exquisitely. You would all
      have greatly enjoyed it. Rowena, you might play something. Well, for my
      part," continued Mrs. Wakeham, settling herself placidly in her
      comfortable chair, "I am glad I am an American. Those European countries,
      it seems to me, are always in some trouble or other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad I am a Canadian," said Larry. "We are much too busy to think of
      anything so foolish and useless as war."

    <h3>
      WAR
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Come, Jane, we have just time to take a look at the lake from the top of
      the hill before we get ready for church," said Ethel Murray. "It will be
      worth seeing to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me too, me too," shrieked two wee girls in bare legs and sandals,
      clutching Jane about the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Isabel; all right, Helen. I'll take you with me," said Jane.
      "But you must let me go, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all raced around the house and began to climb the sheer, rocky hill
      that rose straight up from the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Jim, help me with these kiddies," said Jane to a lank lad of
      fifteen, whom she ran into at the corner of the house just where the climb
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim swung the younger, little Helen, upon his shoulder and together they
      raced to the top, scrambling, slipping, falling, but finally arriving
      there, breathless and triumphant. Before them lay a bit of Canada's
      loveliest lake, the Lake of the Woods, so-called from its myriad, heavily
      wooded islands, that make of its vast expanse a maze of channels, rivers
      and waterways. Calm, without a ripple, lay the glassy, sunlit surface,
      each island, rock and tree meeting its reflected image at the water line,
      the sky above flecked with floating clouds, making with the mirrored sky
      below one perfect whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ethel, I had forgotten just how beautiful this is," breathed Jane,
      while the rest stood silent looking down upon the mirrored rocks and
      islands, trees and sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the two little girls stood perfectly still, for they had been taught
      to take the first views from the top in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the Big Rock," said Helen. "They are two rocks kissing each
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you little sweetheart," said Jane, kissing her. "That is just what
      they are doing. It is not often that you get it so perfectly still as
      this, is it, Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so very often. Sometimes just at sunrise you get it this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At sunrise! Do you very often see it then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he gets up to catch fishes," said wee Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim nodded. "Are you game to come along to-morrow morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't do it, Jane," said Ethel. "It tires you for the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will come, Jim; I would love to come," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they stood gazing down upon the scene below them. Then
      turning to the children abruptly, Ethel said, "Now, then, children, you
      run down and get ready; that is, if you are going to church. Take them
      down, Jim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Ethel," said Jim. "See there, Jane," he continued, "that neck
      of land across the traverse&mdash;that's where the old Hudson Bay trail
      used to run that goes from the Big Lakes to Winnipeg. It's the old war
      trail of the Crees too. Wouldn't you like to have seen them in the old
      days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would run and hide," said Isabel, "so they could not see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not be afraid," said Helen, straightening up to her full height
      of six years. "I would shoot them dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor things," said Jane, in a pitiful voice. "And then their little
      babies at home would cry and cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked distressed. "I would not shoot the ones that had babies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then," said Jane, "the poor wives would sit on the ground and wail
      and wail, like the Indians we heard the other night. Oh, it sounded very
      sad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not shoot the ones with wives or babies or anything," said Helen,
      determined to escape from her painful dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, only the boys and young men?" said Jane. "And then the poor old
      mothers would cry and cry and tear their hair for the boys who would never
      come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen stood in perplexed silence. Then she said shyly, "I wouldn't shoot
      any of them unless they tried to shoot me or Mother or Daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or me," said Jane, throwing her arms around the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Helen, "or you, or anybody in our house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That seems a perfectly safe place to leave it, Helen," said Ethel. "I
      think even the most pronounced pacifist would accept that as a
      justification of war. I fancy that is why poor little Servia is fighting
      big bullying Austria to-day. But run down now; hurry, hurry; the launch
      will be ready in a few minutes, and if you are not ready you know Daddy
      won't wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were ready and with the round dozen, which with the visitors
      constituted the Murray household at their island home, they filled the
      launch, Jim at the wheel. It was a glorious Sunday morning and the whole
      world breathed peace. Through the mazes of the channels among the wooded
      islands the launch made its way, across open traverse, down long waterways
      like rivers between high, wooded banks, through cuts and gaps, where the
      waters boiled and foamed, they ran, for the most part drinking in silently
      the exquisite and varied beauty of lake and sky and woods. Silent they
      were but for the quiet talk and cheery laughter of the younger portion of
      the company, until they neared the little town, when the silence that hung
      over the lake and woods was invaded by other launches outbound and in. The
      Kenora docks were crowded with rowboats, sailboats, canoes and launches of
      all sorts and sizes, so that it took some steering skill on Jim's part to
      land them at the dock without bumping either themselves or any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, look!" exclaimed Isabel, whose sharp eyes were darting everywhere.
      "There's the Rushbrooke's lovely new launch. Isn't it beautiful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh!" shouted Helen. "It is not half as pretty as ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hush, Helen," said the scandalised Isabel. "It is lovely, isnt it,
      Jane? And there is Lloyd Rushbrooke. I think he's lovely, too. And who is
      that with him, Jane&mdash;that pretty girl? Oh, isn't she pretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Helen Brookes," said Jane in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, isn't she lovely!" exclaimed Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely bunch, Isabel," said Jim with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care, they are," insisted Isabel. "And there is Mr. McPherson,
      Jane," she added, her sharp eyes catching sight of their Winnipeg minister
      through the crowd. "He's coming this way. What are the people all waiting
      for, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Andrew McPherson was a tall, slight, dark man, straight but
      for the student's stoop of his shoulders, and with a strikingly Highland
      Scotch cast of countenance, high cheek bones, keen blue eyes set deep
      below a wide forehead, long jaw that clamped firm lips together. He came
      straight to where Mr. Murray and Dr. Brown were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just received from a friend in Winnipeg the most terrible news,"
      he said in a low voice. "Germany has declared war on Russia and France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "War! War! Germany!" exclaimed the men in awed, hushed voices, a startled
      look upon their grave faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, James?" said Mrs. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray repeated the news to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Germany at war?" she said. "I thought it was Austria and Servia. Isn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear," said Mr. Murray hastily, as if anxious to cover up his
      wife's display of ignorance of the European situation. "Austria has been
      at war with Servia for some days, but now Germany has declared war
      apparently upon France and Russia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what has Germany to do with it, or Russia either, or France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved off together from the docks toward the church, discussing the
      ominous news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, look, Jane," said Isabel once more. "There's Ramsay Dunn. Isn't he
      looking funny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pickled, I guess," said Jim, with a glance at the young man who with
      puffed and sodden face was gazing with dull and stupid eyes across the
      lake. On catching sight of the approaching party Ramsay Dunn turned his
      back sharply upon them and became intensely absorbed in the launch at his
      side. But Jane would not have it thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask him to come over this afternoon," she said to Ethel. "His mother
      would like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Ramsay," said Ethel as they passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsay turned sharply, stood stiff and straight, then saluted with an
      elaborate bow. "Good morning, Ethel. Why, good morning, Jane. You down
      here? Delighted to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ramsay, could you come over this afternoon to our island?" said Ethel.
      "Jane is going back this week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing, Ethel. Nothing but scarlet fever, small-pox, or other
      contectious or infagious, confagious or intexious&mdash;eh, disease will
      prevent me. The afternoon or the evening?" he added with what he meant to
      be a most ingratiating smile. "The late afternoon or the early evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girls, who had been staring at him with wide, wondering eyes,
      began to giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be there," continued Ramsay. "I'll be there, I'll be there, when the
      early evening cometh, I'll be there." He bowed deeply to the young ladies
      and winked solemnly at Isabel, who by this time was finding it quite
      impossible to control her giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't he awfully funny?" she said as they moved off. "I think he is
      awfully funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny!" said Ethel. "Disgusting, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ethel, isn't it terribly sad?" said Jane. "Poor Mrs. Dunn, she feels
      so awfully about it. They say he is going on these days in a perfectly
      dreadful way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little brick church was comfortably filled with the townsfolk and with
      such of the summer visitors as had not "left their religion behind them in
      Winnipeg," as Jane said. The preacher was a little man whose speech
      betrayed his birth, and the theology and delivery of whose sermon bore the
      unmistakable marks of his Edinburgh training. He discoursed in somewhat
      formal but in finished style upon the blessings of rest, with obvious
      application to the special circumstances of the greater part of his
      audience who had come to this most beautiful of all Canada's beautiful
      spots seeking these blessings. To further emphasise the value of their
      privileges, he contrasted with their lot the condition of unhappy Servia
      now suffering from the horrors of war and threatened with extinction by
      its tyrannical neighbour, Austria. The war could end only in one way. In
      spite of her gallant and heroic fight Servia was doomed to defeat. But a
      day of reckoning would surely come, for this was not the first time that
      Austria had exercised its superior power in an act of unrighteous tyranny
      over smaller states. The God of righteousness was still ruling in his
      world, and righteousness would be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the service, while they were singing the final hymn, Mr.
      McPherson, after a whispered colloquy with Mr. Murray, made his way to the
      pulpit, where he held an earnest conversation with the minister. Instead
      of pronouncing the benediction and dismissing the congregation when the
      final "Amen" had been sung, the minister invited the people to resume
      their seats, when Mr. McPherson rose and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends, we have just learned that a great and terrible evil has fallen
      upon the world. Five days ago the world was shocked by the announcement
      that Austria had declared war upon Servia. Through these days the powers
      of Europe, or at least some of them, and chief among them Great Britain,
      have been labouring to localise the war and to prevent its extension.
      To-day the sad, the terrible announcement is made that Germany has
      declared war upon both Russia and France. What an hour may bring forth, we
      know not. But not in our day, or in our fathers' day, have we faced so
      great a peril as we face to-day. For we cannot forget that our Empire is
      held by close and vital ties to the Republic of France in the entente
      cordiale. Let us beseech Almighty God to grant a speedy end to war and
      especially to guide the King's counsellors that they may lead this Empire
      in the way that is wise and right and honourable."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the brief prayer that followed there fell upon the people an
      overpowering sense of the futility of man's wisdom, and of the need of the
      might and wisdom that are not man's but God's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Mr. Murray and the children accompanied Dr. Brown and Jane
      to Kenora on their way back to the city. As they were proceeding to the
      railway station they were arrested by a group that stood in front of the
      bulletin board upon which since the war began the local newspaper was wont
      to affix the latest despatches. The group was standing in awed silence
      staring at the bulletin board before them. Dr. Brown pushed his way
      through, read the despatch, looked around upon the faces beside him, read
      the words once more, came back to where his party were standing and stood
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" inquired Mr. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "War," said Dr. Brown in a husky whisper. Then clearing his throat, "War&mdash;Britain
      and Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      War! For the first time in the memory of living man that word was spoken
      in a voice that stopped dead still the Empire in the daily routine of its
      life. War! That word whispered in the secret silent chamber of the man
      whose chief glory had been his title as Supreme War Lord of Europe, swift
      as the lightning's flash circled the globe, arresting multitudes of men
      busy with their peaceful tasks, piercing the hearts of countless women
      with a new and nameless terror, paralysing the activities of nations
      engaged in the arts of peace, transforming into bitter enemies those
      living in the bonds of brotherhood, and loosing upon the world the fiends
      of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray turned to his boy. "Jim," he said, "I must go to Winnipeg. Take
      the children home and tell their mother. I shall wire you to-morrow when
      to meet me." Awed, solemnised and in silence they took their ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the railway station, Mr. Murray changed his mind. He was a man
      clear in thought and swift in action. His first thought had been of his
      business as being immediately affected by this new and mighty fact of war.
      Then he thought of other and wider interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go back, Dr. Brown," he said. "A large number of our business men
      are at the Lake. I suppose half of our Board of Trade are down here. We
      can reach them more easily here than any place else, and it is important
      that we should immediately get them together. Excuse me while I wire to my
      architect. I must stop that block of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned together to the launch. On their way back to their island
      they called to see Mr. McPherson. "You were right," was Mr. Murray's
      greeting to him. "It has come; Britain has declared war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McPherson stood gazing at him in solemn silence. "War," he said at
      length. "We are really in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you were right, Mr. McPherson," said Dr. Brown. "I could not believe
      it; I cannot believe it yet. Why we should have gone into this particular
      quarrel, for the life of me I cannot understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was afraid from the very first," said McPherson, "and when once Russia
      and France were in I knew that Britain could not honourably escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were talking together a launch went swiftly by. "That's the
      Rushbrooke's launch," said Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray rushed out upon the pier and, waving his hand, brought it to a
      halt and finally to the dock. "Have you heard the news?" he said to the
      lady who sat near the stern. "Britain has declared war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," replied Mrs. Rushbrooke, "why on earth has she done that? It is
      perfectly terrible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrible, indeed," said Mr. McPherson. "But we must face it. It changes
      everything in life&mdash;business, society, home, everything will
      immediately feel the effect of this thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. McPherson," exclaimed Mrs. Rushbrooke, "I can hardly see how it
      will quite change everything for us here in Canada. For instance," she
      added with a gay laugh, "I do not see that it will change our bonfire
      tonight. By the way, I see you are not gone, Dr. Brown. You and Jane will
      surely come over; and, Mr. Murray, you will bring your young people and
      Mrs. Murray; and, Mr. McPherson, I hope you will be able to come. It is
      going to be a charming evening and you will see a great many of your
      friends. I think a bonfire on one of the islands makes a very pretty
      sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure whether I can take the time, Mrs. Rushbrooke," said Mr.
      Murray. "I had thought of seeing a number of our business men who are down
      here at the Lake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, can't you leave business even while you are here? You really ought to
      forget business during your holidays, Mr. Murray."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean in relation to the war," said Mr. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious, what can they possibly do about the war down here? But if
      you want to see them they will all be with us to-night. So you had better
      come along. But we shall have to hurry, Lloyd; I have a lot of things to
      do and a lot of people to feed. We have got to live, haven't we?" she
      added as the launch got under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got to live," said Mr. McPherson after they had gone. "Ah, even that
      necessity has been changed. The necessity for living, which I am afraid
      most of us have considered to be of first importance, has suddenly given
      place to another necessity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that?" said Mr. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The necessity not to live, but to do our duty. Life has become all at
      once a very simple thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we have got to keep going in the meantime at any rate," said Mr.
      Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going, yes; but going where?" said Mr. McPherson. "All roads now, for us,
      lead to one spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that spot?" said Mr. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The battlefield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. McPherson, we must not lose our heads; we must keep sane and
      reasonable. Eh, Doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess that this thing has completely stunned me," said Dr. Brown.
      "You see I could not believe, I would not believe that war was possible in
      our day. I would not believe you, Mr. McPherson. I thought you had gone
      mad on this German scare. But you were right. My God, I can't get my
      bearings yet; we are really at war!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God grant that Canada may see its duty clearly," said Mr. McPherson. "God
      make us strong to bear His will."
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried back to their island, each busy with his thoughts, seeking to
      readjust life to this new and horrible environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Murray met them at the dock. "You are back, Dr. Brown," she cried.
      "Did you forget something? We are glad to see you at any rate." Then
      noticing the men's faces, she said, "What is the matter, James? Is there
      anything wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We bring terrible news, Mother," he said. "We are at war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Murray's' mind, like her husband's, moved swiftly. She was a life
      partner in the fullest sense. In business as in the home she shared his
      plans and purposes. "What about the block, James?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wired Eastwood," he replied, "to stop that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Mother?" inquired Isabel, who stood upon the dock clinging to
      her mother's dress, and who saw in the grave, faces about her signs of
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, dear," said her mother. "Nothing that you can understand." She
      would keep from her children this horror as long as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      At lunch in the midst of the most animated conversation the talk would die
      out, and all would be busy fitting their lives to war. Like waves ever
      deepening in volume and increasing in force, the appalling thought of war
      beat upon their minds. After lunch they sat together in the screened
      veranda talking quietly together of the issues, the consequences to them
      and to their community, to their country, and to the world at large, of
      this thing that had befallen them. They made the amazing discovery that
      they were almost entirely ignorant of everything that had to do with war,
      even the relative military strength of the belligerent nations. One thing
      like a solid back wall of rock gave them a sense of security&mdash;the
      British Navy was still supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see, did they cut down the Navy estimates during the last
      Parliament? I know they were always talking of reduction," inquired Mr.
      Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid I know nothing about it," said Dr. Brown. "Last week I would
      have told you 'I hope so'; to-day I profoundly hope not. Jane, you ought
      to know about this. Jane is the war champion in our family," he added with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, there has been no reduction; Winston Churchill has carried on his
      programme. He wanted to halt the building programme, you remember, but the
      Germans would not agree. So I think the Navy is quite up to the mark. But,
      of course," she added, "the German Navy is very strong too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I believe you are right, Jane," said Dr. Brown. "How completely we
      were all hoodwinked. I cannot believe that we are actually at war. Our
      friend Romayne was right. By the way, what about Romayne, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" inquired Mr. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Romayne?" said Dr. Brown. "Oh, he's a great friend of ours in the West.
      He married a sister of young Gwynne, you know. He was an attache of the
      British Embassy in Berlin, and was, as we thought, quite mad on the
      subject of preparation for war. He and Jane hit it off tremendously last
      autumn when we were visiting the Gwynnes. Was he not an officer in the
      Guards or something, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Jane, fear leaping into her eyes. "Oh, Papa, do you think
      he will have to go? Surely he would not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Go back to England?" said Dr. Brown. "I hardly think so. I do not
      know, but perhaps he may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Papa!" exclaimed Jane, the quick tears in her eyes. "Think of his
      wife and little baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" exclaimed Dr. Brown. "It is war that is upon us."
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh wave of horror deeper than any before swept their souls. "Surely
      he won't need to go," he said after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his regiment will be going," said Jane, whose face had become very
      pale and whose eyes were wide with horror. "His regiment will be going
      and," she added, "he will go too." The tears were quietly running down her
      face. She knew Jack Romayne and she had the courage to accept the truth
      which as yet her father put from his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumb they sat, unschooled in language fitted to deal with the tides of
      emotion that surged round this new and overwhelming fact of war. Where
      next would this dread thing strike?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Canada will doubtless send some troops," said Dr. Brown. "We sent to
      South Africa, let me see, was it five thousand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More, I think, Papa," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will send twice or three times that number this time," said Mr.
      Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again silence fell upon them. They were each busy with the question
      who would go. Swiftly their minds ran over the homes of their friends and
      acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Doctor," said Mr. Murray, with a great effort at a laugh, "you
      can't send your boy at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Dr. Brown. "But if my girl had been a boy, I fear I could not
      hold her. Eh, Jane?" But Jane only smiled a very doubtful smile in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may all have to go, Doctor," said Mr. Murray. "If the war lasts long
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, James," said his wife with a quick glance at her two little
      girls. Her boy was fifteen. Thank God, she would not have to face the
      question of his duty in regard to war. "They would not be taking old men
      like you, James," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray laughed at her. "Well, hardly, I suppose, my dear," he replied.
      "I rather guess we won't be allowed to share the glory this time, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brown sat silent for a few moments, then said quietly, "The young
      fellows, of course, will get the first chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let's not talk about it," said Ethel. "Come, Jane, let's go
      exploring."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me, too," cried Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me," cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel hesitated. "Let them come, Ethel," said Jane. "We shall go slowly."
    </p>
    <p>
      An exploration of the island was always a thing of unmixed and varied
      delight. There were something over twenty-five acres of wooded hills
      running up to bare rocks, ravines deep in shrub and ferns, and lower
      levels thick with underbrush and heavy timber. Every step of the way new
      treasures disclosed themselves, ferns and grasses, shrubs and vines, and
      everywhere the wood flowers, shy and sweet. Everywhere, too, on fallen
      logs, on the grey rocks, and on the lower ground where the aromatic
      balsams and pines stood silent and thick, were mosses, mosses of all hues
      and depths. In the sunlit open spaces gorgeous butterflies and gleaming
      dragon flies fluttered and darted, bees hummed, and birds sang and
      twittered. There the children's voices were mingled in cheery shouts and
      laughter with the other happy sounds that filled the glades. But when they
      came to the dark pines, solemn and silent except when the wind moved in
      their tasselled tops with mysterious, mournful whispering, the children
      hushed their voices and walked softly upon the deep moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is like being in church," said Helen, her little soul exquisitely
      sensitive to the mystic, fragrant silences and glooms that haunted the
      pine grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sloping hillside under the pines they lay upon the mossy bed, the
      children listening for the things that lived in these shadowy depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are all looking at us," said Isabel in a voice of awed mystery.
      "Lots and lots of eyes are just looking, looking, and looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Isabel, you give me the creeps," laughed Jane. "Whisht! They'll hear
      you," said Isabel, darting swift glances among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dear things," said Jane. "They would love to play with you if they
      only knew how." This was quite a new idea to the children. Hitherto the
      shy things had been more associated with fear than with play. "They would
      love to play tag with you," continued Jane, "round these trees, if you
      could only coax them out. They are so shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stealthily the children began to move among the bushes, alert for the
      watching eyes and the shy faces of the wild things that made their homes
      in these dark dwellings. The girls sat silent, looking out through the
      interlacing boughs upon the gleam of the lake below. They dearly loved
      this spot. It was a favourite haunt with them, the very spot for
      confidence, and many a happy hour had they spent together here. To-day
      they sat without speech; there was nothing that they cared to talk about.
      It was only yesterday in this same place they had talked over all things
      under the sun. They had exchanged with each other their stores of kindly
      gossip about all their friends and their friends' friends. Only yesterday
      it was that Ethel for the twentieth time had gone over with Jane all the
      intricately perplexing and delightful details in regard to her coming-out
      party next winter. All the boys and girls were to be invited, and Jane was
      to help with the serving. It was only yesterday that in a moment of quite
      unusual frankness Ethel had read snatches of a letter which had come from
      Macleod, who was out in a mission field in Saskatchewan. How they had
      laughed together, all in a kindly way, over the solemn, formal phrases of
      the young Scotch Canadian missionary, Ethel making sport of his solemnity
      and Jane warmly defending him. How they had talked over the boys' affairs,
      as girls will talk, and of their various loves and how they fared, and of
      the cruelties practised upon them. And last of all Ethel had talked of
      Larry, Jane listening warily the while and offering an occasional bit of
      information to keep the talk going. And all of this only yesterday; not
      ten years ago, or a year ago, but yesterday! And to-day not a word seemed
      possible. The world had changed over night. How different from that
      unshaded, sunny world of yesterday! How sunny it was but yesterday! Life
      now was a thing of different values. Ah, that was it. The values were all
      altered. Things big yesterday had shrunk almost to the point of
      disappearance to-day. Things that yesterday seemed remote and vague,
      to-day filled their horizon, for some of them dark enough. Determined to
      ignore that gaunt Spectre standing there, in the shadow silent and grim,
      they would begin to talk on themes good yesterday for an hour's engrossing
      conversation, but before they were aware they had forgotten the subject of
      their talk and found themselves sitting together dumb and looking out upon
      the gleam of the waters, thinking, thinking and ever thinking, while
      nearer and ever more terrible moved the Spectre of War. It was like the
      falling of night upon their world. From the landscape things familiar and
      dear were blotted out, and in their place moved upon them strange shapes
      unreal and horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they gave it up, called the children and went back to the
      others. At the dock they found a launch filled with visitors bringing news&mdash;great
      news and glorious. A big naval battle had been fought in the North Sea!
      Ten British battleships had been sunk, but the whole German fleet had been
      destroyed! For the first time war took on some colour. Crimson and purple
      and gold began to shoot through the sombre black and grey. A completely
      new set of emotions filled their hearts, a new sense of exultation, a new
      pride in that great British Navy which hitherto had been a mere word in a
      history book, or in a song. The children who, after their manner, were
      quickest to catch and to carry on to their utmost limits the emotions of
      the moment, were jubilantly triumphant. Some of them were carrying little
      Union Jacks in their hands. For the first time in their lives that flag
      became a thing of pride and power, a thing to shout for. It stood for
      something invisible but very real. Even their elders were not insensible
      to that something. Hitherto they had taken that flag for granted. They had
      hung it out of their windows on Empire Day or on Dominion Day as a
      patriotic symbol, but few of them would have confessed, except in a
      half-shamed, apologetic way, to any thrill at the flapping of that bit of
      bunting. They had shrunk from a display of patriotic emotion. They were
      not like their American cousins, who were ever ready to rave over Old
      Glory. That sort of emotional display was un-Canadian, un-British. But
      to-day somehow the flag had changed. The flag had changed because it
      fluttered in a new world, a new light fell upon it, the light of battle.
      It was a war flag to-day. Men were fighting under it, were fighting for
      all it represented, were dying under its folds, and proudly and gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And all the men will go to fight, your father and my father, and all the
      big boys," Ethel heard a little friend confide to Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, Mabel," said Ethel sharply. "Don't be silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the word had been spoken and as a seed it fell upon fertile soil. The
      launch went off with the children waving their flags and cheering. And
      again upon those left upon the dock the shadow settled heavier than
      before. That was the way with that shadow. It was always heavier, thicker,
      more ominous after each interlude of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same at the bonfire in the evening at the Rushbrookes'. The
      island was a fairy picture of mingling lights and shadows. As the flaming
      west grew grey, the pale silver of the moon, riding high and serene, fell
      upon the crowding, gaily decked launches that thronged the docks and
      moored to the shore; upon the dark balsams and silver birches hung with
      parti-coloured gaudy Chinese lanterns; upon the groups of girls, fair and
      sweet in their white summer camping frocks, and young men in flannels,
      their bare necks and arms showing brown and strong; upon little clusters
      of their fathers and mothers gravely talking together. From the veranda
      above, mingling with the laughing, chattering voices, the alluring strains
      of the orchestra invited to waltz, or fox trot. As the flame died from the
      western sky and the shadows crept down from the trees, the bonfire was set
      alight. As the flame leaped high the soft strains of the orchestra died
      away. Then suddenly, clear, full and strong, a chord sounded forth,
      another, and then another. A hush fell upon the chattering, laughing
      crowd. Then as they caught the strain men lolling upon the ground sprang
      to their feet; lads stood at attention.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Send him victorious,"
</pre>
    <p>
      some one sang timidly, giving words to the music. In one instant a hundred
      throats were wide open singing the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Happy and glorious,
      Long to reign over us,
      God save our King."
</pre>
    <p>
      Again the chords sounded and at once the verse from the first was sung
      again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "God save our gracious King,
      Long live our noble King,
      God save our King,
      Send him victorious,
      Happy and glorious,
      Long to reign over us,
      God save our King."
</pre>
    <p>
      As the last note died Ramsay Dunn leaped upon a huge boulder, threw up his
      hand and began,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "In days of yore, from Britain's shore."
</pre>
    <p>
      A yell greeted him, sudden, fierce, triumphant, drowned his voice, then
      ceased! And again from a hundred throats of men and women, boys and girls,
      the words rang out,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "There may it wave, our boast and pride,
      And joined in love together,
      The thistle, shamrock, rose entwine,
      The Maple Leaf forever."
</pre>
    <p>
      Again and again and once again they followed Ramsay in the quick, shrill
      Canadian cheer that was to be heard in after days in places widely
      different and far remote from that gay, moonlit, lantern-decked,
      boat-thronged, water-lapped island in that far northern Canadian lake.
      Following the cheers there came stillness. Men looked sheepishly at each
      other as if caught in some silly prank. Then once more the Spectre drew
      near. But this time they declined not to look, but with steady, grave,
      appraising eyes they faced The Thing, resolute to know the worst, and in
      quiet undertones they talked together of War.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bonfire roared gloriously up through the dark night, throwing far
      gleams out upon the moonlit waters in front and upon the dark woods
      behind. The people gathered about the fire and disposed themselves in
      groups upon the sloping, grassy sward under the trees, upon the shelving
      rocks and upon the sandy shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Murray had business on hand. In company with Dr. Brown and the
      minister, Mr. McPherson, he sought his host. "Would it be possible, Mr.
      Rushbrooke," he said, "to gather a number of business men here together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" inquired Rushbrooke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I may be all wrong," said Mr. Murray apologetically, "but I have
      the feeling that we ought without delay to discuss what preliminary steps
      should be taken to meet with the critical conditions brought on by the
      war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mr. Murray," cried Mrs. Rushbrooke, who was standing by her
      husband's side, "they are all so happy it would seem a great pity to
      introduce this horrible thing at such a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think it necessary, Murray?" said Mr. Rushbrooke, who was
      an older man than Mr. Murray, and who was unwilling to accede to him any
      position of dominance in the business world of Winnipeg. "There's really
      nothing we can do. It seems to me that we must keep our heads and as far
      as possible prevent undue excitement and guard against panic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are right, Mr. Rushbrooke. The thought in my mind was that we
      ought to get a meeting together in Winnipeg soon. But everybody is away. A
      great many are here at the Lake; it seemed a good opportunity to make some
      preliminary arrangement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Murray," said Mrs. Rushbrooke, "I cannot help feeling that
      you take this too seriously, besides there can hardly be need for such
      precipitate action. Of course, we are at war, and Canada will do her part,
      but to introduce such a horrible theme in a company of young people seems
      to me to be somehow out of place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Mrs. Rushbrooke, if you say so. I have no desire to intrude,"
      said Mr. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mr. Rushbrooke, the thing has to be faced," interposed Mr.
      McPherson. "We cannot shut our eyes to the fact of war, and this is the
      supreme fact in our national life to-day. Everything else is secondary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I do not agree with you, Mr. McPherson," said Mrs. Rushbrooke, taking
      the word out of her husband's mouth. "Of course war is terrible and all
      that, but men must do their work. The Doctor here must continue to look
      after his sick, Mr. Murray has his business, you must care for your
      congregation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know about that, Mrs. Rushbrooke," said the minister. "I do not
      know about that at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. McPherson, you surprise me! Must not my husband attend to his
      business, must not the Doctor look after his patients?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of men had gathered about during the course of the conversation.
      "No," said Mr. McPherson, his voice ringing out in decided tones. "There
      is only one 'must' for us now, and that is War. For the Empire, for every
      man, woman, and child in Canada, the first thing, and by comparison the
      only thing, is War."
    </p>
    <p>
      That dread word rang out sharp, insistent, penetrating through the quiet
      hum of voices rising from the groups about the fire. By this time a very
      considerable number of men present had joined themselves to the group
      about the speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Murray," said Mr. Rushbrooke, with a laugh, "it seems to me
      that we cannot help it very well. If you wish to discourse upon the war,
      you have your audience and you have my permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not my intention to discourse upon the war, Mr. Rushbrooke, but
      with your permission I will just tell our friends here how my mind has
      worked since learning this terrible news this morning. My first impulse
      was to take the first train to Winnipeg, for I know that it will be
      necessary for me to readjust my business to the new conditions created by
      war. My second thought was that there were others like me; that, in fact,
      the whole business public of Winnipeg would be similarly affected. I felt
      the need of counsel so that I should make no mistake that would imperil
      the interests of others. I accepted Mrs. Rushbrooke's invitation to come
      to-night in the hope of meeting with a number of the business men of
      Winnipeg. The more I think of it the more terrible this thing becomes. The
      ordinary conditions of business are gone. We shall all need to readjust
      ourselves in every department of life. It seems to me that we must stand
      together and meet this calamity as best we can, wisely, fairly and
      fearlessly. The main point to be considered is, should we not have a
      general meeting of the business men of Winnipeg, and if so, when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray's words were received in deep silence, and for a time no one
      made reply. Then Mr. Rushbrooke made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all feel the importance of what Mr. Murray has said. Personally,
      though, I am of the opinion that we should avoid all unnecessary
      excitement and everything approaching panic. The war will doubtless be a
      short one. Germany, after long preparation, has decided to challenge Great
      Britain's power. Still, Britain is ready for her. She has accepted the
      challenge; and though her army is not great, she is yet not unprepared.
      Between the enemy and Britain's shores there lies that mighty, invisible
      and invincible line of defence, the British navy. With the French armies
      on the one side and the Russian on the other, Germany can not last. In
      these days, with the terrible engines of destruction that science has
      produced, wars will be short and sharp. Germany will get her medicine and
      I hope it will do her good."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Rushbrooke expected his somewhat flamboyant speech to awaken
      enthusiastic approval, he must have been disappointed. His words were
      received in grave silence. The fact of war was far too unfamiliar and too
      overwhelming to make it easy for them to compass it in their thoughts or
      to deal in any adequate way with its possible issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some moments of silence the minister spoke. "I wish I could agree
      with Mr. Rushbrooke," he said. "But I cannot. My study of this question
      has impressed me with the overwhelming might of Germany's military power.
      The war may be short and sharp, and that is what Germany is counting upon.
      But if it be short and sharp, the issue will be a German victory. The
      French army is not fully prepared, I understand. Russia is an untrained
      and unwieldy mass. There is, of course, the British navy, and with all my
      heart I thank God that our fleet appears to be fit for service. But with
      regard even to our navy we ought to remember that it is as yet untried in
      modern warfare. I confess I cannot share Mr. Rushbrooke's optimistic views
      as to the war. But whether he be right or I, one thing stands out clear in
      my mind&mdash;that we should prepare ourselves to do our duty. At whatever
      cost to our country or to ourselves, as individuals, this duty is laid
      upon us. It is the first, the immediate, the all-absorbing duty of every
      man, woman and child in Canada to make war. God help us not to shrink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many in this company will be in Winnipeg this week, say to-morrow?"
      inquired Mr. Murray. The hand of every business man in the company went
      up. "Then suppose we call a meeting at my office immediately upon the
      arrival of the train." And to this they agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rushbrooke bonfire was an annual event and ever the most notable of
      all its kind during the holiday season at the Lake. This year the
      preparations for the festive gathering had exceeded those of previous
      years, and Mrs. Rushbrooke's expectations of a brilliantly successful
      function were proportionately high. But she had not counted upon War. And
      so it came that ever as the applause following song or story died down,
      the Spectre drew near, and upon even the most light-hearted of the company
      a strange quiet would fall, and they would find themselves staring into
      the fire forgetful of all about them, thinking of what might be. They
      would have broken up early but Mrs. Rushbrooke strenuously resisted any
      such attempt. But the sense of the impending horror chilled the gaiety of
      the evening and halted the rush of the fun till the hostess gave up in
      despair and no longer opposed the departure of her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. McPherson," she said, as that gentleman came to bid her good-night,
      "I am quite cross with you. You made us all feel so blue and serious that
      you quite spoiled our bonfire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish it were only I that had spoiled it, Mrs. Rushbrooke," said Mr.
      McPherson gravely. "But even your graceful hospitality to-night, which has
      never been excelled even by yourself at the Lake of the Woods, could not
      make us forget, and God forgive us if we do forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. McPherson," persisted Mrs. Rushbrooke, in a voice that strove to
      be gaily reproachful, "we must not become pessimistic. We must be cheerful
      even if we are at war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for that word," said the minister solemnly. "It is a true word
      and a right word, and it is a word we shall need to remember more and
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man would drive me mad," said Mrs. Rushbrooke to Mr. Murray as they
      watched the boats away. "I am more than thankful that he is not my
      clergyman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," said her husband, who stood near her and shared her
      feelings of disappointment. "It seems to me he takes things far too
      seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," said Dr. Brown, who stood with Mr. Murray preparatory to
      taking his departure. "I wonder if we know just how serious this thing is.
      I frankly confess, Mr. Rushbrooke, that my mind has been in an appalling
      condition of chaos this afternoon; and every hour the thing grows more
      terrible as I think of it. But as you say, we must cheer up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely we must," replied Rushbrooke impatiently. "I am convinced this war
      will soon be over. In three months the British navy together with the
      armies of their allies will wind this thing up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a wonder world of moonlit waterways and dark, mysterious channels,
      around peninsulas and between islands, across an open traverse and down a
      little bay, they took their course until Jim had them safely landed at
      their own dock again. The magic beauty of the white light upon wooded
      island and gleaming lake held them in its spell for some minutes after
      they had landed till Mrs. Murray came down from the bungalow to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Safe back again," she cried with an all too evident effort to be cheery.
      "How lovely the night is, and how peaceful! James," she said in a low
      voice, turning to her husband, "I wish you would go to Isabel. I cannot
      get her to sleep. She says she must see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think she has got a little fright," said his wife. "She has been
      sobbing pitifully."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray found the little thing wide awake, her breath coming in the
      deep sobs of exhaustion that follows tempestuous tears. "What's the
      trouble, Sweetheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Daddy," cried the child, flinging herself upon him and bursting anew
      into an ecstasy of weeping, "she&mdash;said&mdash;you would&mdash;have&mdash;to&mdash;go.
      But&mdash;you won't&mdash;will you&mdash;Daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Isabel, what do you mean, dear? Go where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the&mdash;war&mdash;Daddy&mdash;they said&mdash;you would&mdash;have&mdash;to
      go&mdash;to the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mabel. But&mdash;you&mdash;won't, will you, Daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mabel is a silly little goose," said Mr. Murray angrily. "No, never fear,
      my Sweetheart, they won't expect me to go. I am far too old, you know.
      Now, then, off you go to sleep. Do you know, the moon is shining so bright
      outside that the little birds can't sleep. I just heard a little bird as
      we were coming home cheeping away just like, you. I believe she could not
      go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the child could not forget that terrible word which had rooted itself
      in her heart. "But you will not go; promise me, Daddy, you will not go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Sweetheart, listen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But promise me, Daddy, promise me." The little thing clung to him in a
      paroxysm of grief and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Isabel dear," said her father quietly. "You know I always tell
      you the truth. Now listen to me. I promise you I won't go until you send
      me yourself. Will that do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Daddy," she said, and drew a long breath. "Now I am so tired,
      Daddy." Even as she spoke the little form relaxed in his arms and in a
      moment she was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her father held her there the Spectre drew near again, but for the
      moment his courage failed him and he dared not look.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TUCK OF DRUM
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the midst of her busy summer work in field and factory, on lake and
      river, in mine and forest, on an August day of 1914, Canada was stricken
      to the heart. Out of a blue summer sky a bolt as of death smote her, dazed
      and dumb, gasping to God her horror and amaze. Without word of warning,
      without thought of preparation, without sense of desert, War, brutal,
      bloody, devilish War, was thrust into her life by that power whose
      business in the world, whose confidence and glory, was war.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days, stunned by the unexpectedness of the blow, as much as by
      its weight, Canada stood striving to regain her poise. Then with little
      outcry, and with less complaint, she gathered herself for her spring. A
      week, and then another, she stood breathless and following with eyes
      astrain the figure of her ally, little Belgium, gallant and heroic, which
      had moved out upon the world arena, the first to offer battle to the
      armour-weighted, monstrous war lord of Europe, on his way to sate his soul
      long thirsty for blood&mdash;men's if he could, women's and little
      children's by preference, being less costly. And as she stood and strained
      her eyes across the sea by this and other sights moved to her soul's
      depths, she made choice, not by compulsion but of her own free will, of
      war, and having made her choice, she set herself to the business of
      getting ready. From Pacific to Atlantic, from Vancouver to Halifax,
      reverberated the beat of the drum calling for men willing to go out and
      stand with the Empire's sons in their fight for life and faith and
      freedom. Twenty-five thousand Canada asked for. In less than a month a
      hundred thousand men were battering at the recruiting offices demanding
      enlistment in the First Canadian Expeditionary Force. From all parts of
      Canada this demand was heard, but nowhere with louder insistence than in
      that part which lies beyond the Great Lakes. In Winnipeg, the Gateway City
      of the West, every regiment of militia at once volunteered in its full
      strength for active service. Every class in the community, every
      department of activity, gave an immediate response to the country's call.
      The Board of Trade; the Canadian Club, that free forum of national public
      opinion; the great courts of the various religious bodies; the great
      fraternal societies and whatsoever organisation had a voice, all pledged
      unqualified, unlimited, unhesitating support to the Government in its
      resolve to make war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the first week of war wild rumours flew of victory and disaster,
      but the heart of Winnipeg as of the nation was chiefly involved in the
      tragic and glorious struggle of little Belgium. And when two weeks had
      gone and Belgium, bruised, crushed, but unconquered, lay trampled in the
      bloody dust beneath the brutal boots of the advancing German hordes,
      Canada with the rest of the world had come to measure more adequately the
      nature and the immensity of the work in hand. By her two weeks of glorious
      conflict Belgium had uncovered to the world's astonished gaze two
      portentous and significant facts: one, stark and horrible, that the German
      military power knew neither ruth nor right; the other, gloriously
      conspicuous, that Germany's much-vaunted men-of-war were not invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first Sunday of the war the churches of Winnipeg were full to the
      doors. Men, whose attendance was more or less desultory and to a certain
      extent dependent upon the weather, were conscious of an impulse to go to
      church. War had shaken the foundations of their world, and men were
      thinking their deepest thoughts and facing realities too often neglected
      or minimised. "I have been thinking of God these days," said a man to Mr.
      Murray as they walked home from business on Saturday, and there were many
      like him in Canada in those first days of August. Without being able
      definitely to define it there was in the hearts of men a sense of need of
      some clear word of guiding, and in this crisis of Canadian history the
      churches of Canada were not found wanting. The same Spirit that in ancient
      days sent forth the Hebrew Isaiah with a message of warning and counsel
      for the people of his day and which in the great crises of nations has
      found utterance through the lips of men of humble and believing hearts
      once more became a source of guidance and of courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message varied with the character and training of the messenger. In
      the church of which Reverend Andrew McPherson was the minister the people
      were called to repentance and faith and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to the Word of God," cried the minister, "spoken indeed to men of
      another race and another time, but spoken as truly for the men of this day
      and of this nation. 'Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of
      Israel; I am Jehovah thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth
      thee by the way that thou shouldst go. Oh, that thou wouldst hearken to my
      commandments! then would thy peace be as a river, and thy righteousness as
      the waves of the sea. . . . There is no peace, saith Jehovah, to the
      wicked.' Echoing down through the centuries, these great words have
      verified themselves in every age and may in our day verify themselves
      anew. Peace and righteousness are necessarily and eternally bound
      together." He refused to discuss with them to-day the causes of this
      calamity that had fallen upon them and upon the world. But in the name of
      that same Almighty, Holy God, he summoned the people to repentance and to
      righteousness, for without righteousness there could be no peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Cathedral there rang out over the assembled people the Call to
      Sacrifice. "He that saveth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his
      life for My sake shall find it." The instinct to save life was fundamental
      and universal. There were times when man must resist that instinct and
      choose to surrender life. Such was the present time. Dear as life was,
      there were things infinitely more precious to mankind, and these things
      were in peril. For the preserving of these things to the world our Empire
      had resolved upon war, and throughout the Empire the call had sounded
      forth for men willing to sacrifice their lives. To this call Canada would
      make response, and only thus could Canada save her life. For faith, for
      righteousness, for humanity, our Empire had accepted war. And now, as
      ever, the pathway to immortality for men and for nations was the pathway
      of sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In St. Mary's the priest, an Irishman of warm heart and of fiery fighting
      spirit, summoned the faithful to faith and duty. To faith in the God of
      their fathers who through his church had ever led his people along the
      stern pathway of duty. The duty of the hour was that of united and
      whole-hearted devotion to the cause of Freedom, for which Great Britain
      had girded on her sword. The heart of the Empire had been thrilled by the
      noble words of the leader of the Irish Party in the House of Commons at
      Home, in which he pledged the Irish people to the cause of the world's
      Freedom. In this great struggle all loyal Sons of Canada of all races and
      creeds would be found united in the defence of this sacred cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper press published full reports of many of the sermons
      preached. These sermons all struck the same note&mdash;repentance,
      sacrifice, service. On Monday morning men walked with surer tread because
      the light was falling clearer upon the path they must take.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when Jane and her friend, Ethel Murray, were on their way
      downtown, they heard the beat of a drum. Was it fancy, or was there in
      that beat something they had never heard in a drum beat before, something
      more insistent, more compelling? They hurried to Portage Avenue and there
      saw Winnipeg's famous historic regiment, the Ninetieth Rifles, march with
      quick, brisk step to the drum beat of their bugle band.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," cried Ethel, "there's Pat Scallons, and Ted Tuttle, and Fred
      Sharp, too. I did not know that he belonged to the Ninetieth." And as they
      passed, rank on rank, Ethel continued to name the friends whom she
      recognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane stood uttering no word. The sight of these lads stepping to the
      drum beat so proudly had sent a chill to her heart and tears to her eyes.
      "Oh, Ethel," she cried, touching her friend's arm, "isn't it terrible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's the matter?" cried Ethel, glancing at her. "Think of what
      they are marching to!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can't bear it," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ethel was more engaged with the appearance of the battalion, from the
      ranks of which she continued to pick out the faces of her friends. "Look,"
      she cried, "that surely is not Kellerman! It is! It is! Look, Jane,
      there's that little Jew. Is it possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kellerman?" cried Jane. "No, it can't be he. There are no Jews in the
      Ninetieth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is," cried Ethel. "It is Kellerman. Let us go up to Broadway and
      we shall meet them again."
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned up a cross street and were in time to secure a position from
      which they could get a good look at the faces of the lads as they passed.
      The battalion was marching at attention, and so rigid was the discipline
      that not a face was turned toward the two young ladies standing at the
      street corner. A glance of the eye and a smile they received from their
      friends as they passed, but no man turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There he is," said Jane. "It is Kellerman&mdash;in the second row, see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure enough, it is Kellerman," said Ethel. "Well, what has come to
      Winnipeg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "War," said Jane solemnly. "And a good many more of the boys will be going
      too, if they are any good."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kellerman came stepping along he caught sight of the girls standing
      there, but no sign of recognition did he make. He was too anxious to be
      considered a soldier for that. Steadiness was one of the primary
      principles knocked into the minds of recruits by the Sergeant Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls moved along after the column had passed at a sufficient distance
      to escape the rabble. At the drill hall they found the street blocked by a
      crowd of men, women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is all this, I wonder?" said Ethel. "Let us wait here awhile.
      Perhaps we may come across some one we know."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange crowd that gathered about the entrance to the drill hall,
      not the usual assemblage of noisy, idly curious folk of the lighter weight
      that are wont to follow a marching battalion or gather to the sound of a
      band. It was composed of substantial and solid people, serious in face and
      quiet in demeanour. They were there on business, a business of the gravest
      character. As the girls stood waiting they heard far down Broadway the
      throbbing of drums.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Ethel," cried Jane. "The Pipes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Pipes!" echoed Ethel in great excitement. "The Kilties!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the roll and rattle of the drums they caught those high,
      heart-thrilling sounds which for nearly two hundred years have been heard
      on every famous British battlefield, and which have ever led Scotland's
      sons down the path of blood and death to imperishable glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young Ninetieth officer, intent on seeing that the way was kept clear
      for the soldiers, came striding out of the armoury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there's Frank Smart," said Ethel. "I wish he would see us."
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to her wish, Smart turned about and saw them in the crowd.
      Immediately he came to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know you were a soldier, Frank," said Jane, greeting him with a
      radiant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had almost forgotten it myself," said Frank. "But I was at church
      yesterday and I went home and looked up my uniform and here I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not going across, Frank, are you?" said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can. There is very strong competition between both officers and men.
      I have been paying little attention to soldiering for a year or so; I have
      been much too busy. But now things are different. If I can make it, I
      guess I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Frank, YOU don't need to go, said Ethel. I mean there are heaps of
      men all over Canada wanting to go. Why should YOU go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question a fellow must ask himself is rather why should he stay,"
      replied the young officer. "Don't you think so, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Jane, drawing in her breath sharply but smiling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want to go in?" asked Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do let's go in," said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane shrank back. "I don't like to go through all those men," she
      said, "though I should like greatly to see Kellerman," she added. "I
      wonder if I could see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kellerman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's Jane's special, you know," said Ethel. "They ran close together
      for the German prize, you remember. You don't know him? A little Jew
      chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't know him," said Smart. "But you can certainly see him if you
      wish. Just come with me; I will get you in. But first I have got to see
      that this way is kept clear for the Highlanders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let's wait to see them come up," said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, stand here," said Frank. "There may be a crush, but if you
      don't mind that we will follow right after them. Here they come. Great
      lads, aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they have their big feather bonnets on, too," said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the street the Highlanders came in column of fours, the pipe band
      leading.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't they gorgeous?" said Smart with generous praise for a rival
      battalion. "Chesty-looking devils, eh?" he added as they drew near. "You
      would think that Pipe Major owned at least half of Winnipeg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the big drummer the other half," added Ethel. "Look at his sticks.
      He's got a classy twirl, hasn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gorgeous they were, their white spats flashing in time with their step,
      their kilts swaying free over their tartan hose and naked knees, their
      white tunics gleaming through the dusk of the evening, and over all the
      tossing plumes of their great feather bonnets nodding rhythmically with
      their swinging stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mighty glad we have not to fight those boys," said Frank as the column
      swung past into the armoury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd which on other occasions would have broken into enthusiastic
      cheers to-night stood in silence while the Highlanders in all their
      gorgeous splendour went past. That grave silence was characteristic of the
      Winnipeg crowds those first days of war. Later they found voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we can go in. Come right along," said Smart. "Stand clear there,
      boys. You can't go in unless you have an order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ar-r-e wantin' tae join," said a Scotch voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, eh? Come along then. Fall into line there." The men immediately
      dropped into line. "Ah, you have been there before, I see," said Smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, ye'er-r-r right ther-r-re, sir-r-r," answered the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be for the Kilties, boys?" said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye. What else?" asked the same man in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only one regiment for the Scotchman apparently," said Frank,
      leading the way to the door. "Just hold these men here until I see what's
      doing, will you?" he said to the sentry as he passed in. "Now, then, young
      ladies, step to your right and await me in that corner. I must see what's
      to be done with these recruits. Then I shall find Kellerman for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no need to look for Kellerman, for before he returned the
      little Jew had caught sight of the young ladies and had made his way to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, how splendid you look, Mr. Kellerman," said Ethel. "I did not know
      you were in the Ninetieth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't until Friday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say you joined up to go away?" inquired Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what," said Kellerman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are&mdash;I mean&mdash;I do not see&mdash;" Ethel stopped in
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you mean, Miss Murray, is that you are surprised at a Jew joining a
      military organisation," said Kellerman with a quiet dignity quite new to
      him. Formerly his normal condition was one of half defiant, half cringing
      nervousness in the presence of ladies. To-night he carried himself with an
      easy self-possession, and it was due to more than the uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you are right. It is horrid of me and I am awfully sorry,"
      said Ethel, impulsively offering him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you join, Mr. Kellerman?" said Jane in her quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I hardly know if I can tell you. I will, though," he added with a
      sudden impulse, "if you care to hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do tell us," said Ethel. But Kellerman looked at Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you care to tell, Mr. Kellerman," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Jew stood silent a few minutes, leaning upon his rifle and
      looking down upon the ground. Then in a low, soft voice he began: "I was
      born in Poland&mdash;German Poland. The first thing I remember is seeing
      my mother kneeling, weeping and wringing her hands beside my father's dead
      body outside the door of our little house in our village. He was a
      student, a scholar, and a patriot." Kellerman's voice took on a deeper and
      firmer tone. "He stood for the Polish language in the schools. There was a
      riot in our village. A German officer struck my father down and killed him
      on the ground. My mother wiped the blood off his white face&mdash;I can
      see that white face now&mdash;with her apron. She kept that apron; she has
      it yet. We got somehow to London soon after that. The English people were
      good to us. The German people are tyrants. They have no use for free
      peoples." The little Jew's words snapped through his teeth. "When war came
      a week ago I could not sleep for two nights. On Friday I joined the
      Ninetieth. That night I slept ten hours." As he finished his story the lad
      stood staring straight before him into the moving crowd. He had forgotten
      the girls who with horror-stricken faces had been listening to him. He was
      still seeing that white face smeared with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your mother?" said Jane gently as she laid her hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy started. "My mother? Oh, my mother, she went with me to the
      recruiting office and saw me take the oath. She is satisfied now."
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments the girls stood silent, unable to find their voices. Then
      Jane said, her eyes glowing with a deep inner light, "Mr. Kellerman, I am
      proud of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Miss Brown; it does me good to hear you say that. But you have
      always been good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I want you to come and see me before you go," said Jane as she gave
      him her hand. "Now will you take us out through the crowd? We must get
      along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Miss Brown. Just come with me." With a fine, soldierly tread
      the young Jew led them through the crowd and put them on their way. He did
      not shake hands with them as he said good-bye, but gave them instead a
      military salute, of which he was apparently distinctly proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, Jane," said Ethel, as they set off down the street, "am I awake?
      Is that little Kellerman, the greasy little Jew whom we used to think such
      a beast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't he splendid?" said Jane. "Poor little Kellerman! You know, Ethel,
      he had not one girl friend in college? I am sorry now we were not better
      to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were full of people walking hurriedly or gathered here and
      there in groups, all with grave, solemn faces. In front of The Times
      office a huge concourse stood before the bulletin boards reading the
      latest despatches. These were ominous enough: "The Germans Still Battering
      Liege Forts&mdash;Kaiser's Army Nearing Brussels&mdash;Four Millions of
      Men Marching on France&mdash;Russia Hastening Her Mobilisation&mdash;Kitchener
      Calls for One Hundred Thousand Men&mdash;Canada Will Send Expeditionary
      Force of Twenty-five Thousand Men&mdash;Camp at Valcartier Nearly Ready&mdash;Parliament
      Assembles Thursday." Men read the bulletins and talked quietly to each
      other. They had not yet reached clearness in their thinking as to how this
      dread thing had fallen upon their country so far from the storm centre, so
      remote in all vital relations. There was no cheering&mdash;the cheering
      days came later&mdash;no ebullient emotion, but the tightening of lip and
      jaw in their stern, set faces was a sufficient index of the tensity of
      feeling. Canadians were thinking things out, thinking keenly and swiftly,
      for in the atmosphere and actuality of war mental processes are carried on
      at high pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girls stood at the corner of Portage Avenue and Main waiting for a
      crossing, an auto held up in the traffic drew close to their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Ethel! Won't you get in?" said a voice at their ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Lloyd! Hello, Helen!" cried Ethel. "We will, most certainly. Are
      you joying, or what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both," said Lloyd Rushbrooke, who was at the wheel. "Helen wanted to see
      the soldiers. She is interested in the Ninetieth but he wasn't there and I
      am just taking her about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We saw the Ninetieth and the Kilties too," said Ethel. "Oh, they are
      fine! Oh, Helen, whom do you think we saw in the Ninetieth? You will never
      guess&mdash;Heinrich Kellerman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord! That greasy little Sheeney?" exclaimed Rushbrooke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out, Lloyd. He's Jane's friend," said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lloyd laughed uproariously at the joke. "And you say the little Yid was in
      the Ninetieth? Well, what is the Ninetieth coming to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lloyd, you mustn't say a word against Mr. Kellerman," said Jane. "I think
      he is a real man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, Jane. That little Hebrew Shyster? Why, he does not wash more
      than once a year!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care if he never washes at all. I won't have you speak of him
      that way," said Jane. "I mean it. He is a friend of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of mine, too," said Ethel, "since to-night. Why, he gave me thrills
      up in the armoury as he told us why he joined up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One ten per, eh?" said Lloyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell him?" said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you will not," said Jane decidedly. "Lloyd would not understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I say, Jane, don't spike a fellow like that. I am just joking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't have you joke in that way about Mr. Kellerman, at least, not to
      me." Few of her college mates had ever seen Jane angry. They all
      considered her the personification of even-tempered serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you take it that way, of course I apologise," said Lloyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now listen to me, Lloyd," said Jane. "I am going to tell you why he
      joined up." And in tones thrilling with the intensity of her emotion and
      finally breaking, she recounted Kellerman's story. "And that is why he is
      going to the war, and I am proud of him," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid!" cried Helen Brookes. "You are in the Ninetieth, too, Lloyd,
      aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lloyd. "At least, I was. I have not gone much lately. I have
      not had time for the military stuff, so I canned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we saw Pat Scallons and Ted Tuttle in the Ninetieth, too, and Ramsay
      Dunn&mdash;oh, he did look fine in his uniform&mdash;and Frank Smart&mdash;he
      is going if he can," said Ethel. "I wonder what his mother will do. He is
      the only son, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you ask me, I think that is rot. It is not right for Smart.
      There are lots of fellows who can go," said Lloyd in quite an angry tone.
      "Why, they say they have nearly got the twenty-five thousand already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My, I would like to be in the first twenty-five thousand if I were a
      man," said Ethel. "There is something fine in that. Wouldn't you, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not a man," said Jane shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the first twenty-five thousand?" said Lloyd. "Oh, that is just
      sentimental rot. If a man was really needed, he would go; but if not, why
      should he? There's no use getting rattled over this thing. Besides,
      somebody's got to keep things going here. I think that is a fine British
      motto that they have adopted in England, 'Business as usual.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Business as usual!'" exclaimed Jane in a tone of unutterable contempt.
      "I think I must be going home, Lloyd," she added. "Can you take me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the rush, Jane? It is early yet. Let's take a turn out to the
      Park."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane insisted on going home. Never before in all her life had she
      found herself in a mood in which she could with difficulty control her
      speech. She could not understand how it was that Lloyd Rushbrooke, whom
      she had always greatly liked, should have become at once distasteful to
      her. She could hardly bear the look upon his handsome face. His clever,
      quick-witted fun, which she had formerly enjoyed, now grated horribly. Of
      all the college boys in her particular set, none was more popular, none
      better liked, than Lloyd Rushbrooke. Now she was mainly conscious of a
      desire to escape from his company. This feeling distressed her. She wanted
      to be alone that she might think it out. That was Jane's way. She always
      knew her own mind, could always account for her emotions, because she was
      intellectually honest and had sufficient fortitude to look facts in the
      face. At the door she did not ask even her friend, Ethel, to come in with
      her. Nor did she make excuse for omitting this courtesy. That, too, was
      Jane's way. She was honest with her friends as with herself. She employed
      none of the little fibbing subterfuges which polite manners approve and
      which are employed to escape awkward situations, but which, of course,
      deceive no one. She was simple, sincere, direct in her mental and moral
      processes, and possessed a courage of the finest quality. Under ordinary
      circumstances she would have cleared up her thinking and worked her soul
      through the mist and stress of the rough weather by talking it over with
      her father or by writing a letter to Larry. But during the days of the
      past terrible week she had discovered that her father, too, was
      tempest-tossed to an even greater degree than she was herself; and somehow
      she had no heart to write to Larry. Indeed, she knew not what to say. Her
      whole world was in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Winnipeg there were many like her. In every home, while faces
      carried bold fronts, there was heart searching of the ultimate depths and
      there was purging of souls. In every office, in every shop, men went about
      their work resolute to keep minds sane, faces calm, and voices steady, but
      haunted by a secret something which they refused to call fear&mdash;which
      was not fear&mdash;but which as yet they were unwilling to acknowledge and
      which they were unable to name. With every bulletin from across the sea
      the uncertainty deepened. Every hour they waited for news of a great
      victory for the fleet. The second day of the war a rumour of such a
      victory had come across the wires and had raised hopes for a day which
      next day were dashed to despair. One ray of light, thin but marvellously
      bright, came from Belgium. For these six breathless days that gallant
      little people had barred the way against the onrushing multitudes of
      Germany's military hosts. The story of the defence of Liege was to the
      Allies like a big drink of wine to a fainting man. But Belgium could not
      last. And what of France? What France would do no man could say. It was
      exceedingly doubtful whether there was in the French soul that enduring
      quality, whether in the army or in the nation, that would be steadfast in
      the face of disaster. The British navy was fit, thank God! But as to the
      army, months must elapse before a British army of any size could be on the
      fighting line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another agonising week passed and still there was no sure word of hope
      from the Front. In Canada one strong, heartening note had been sounded.
      The Canadian Parliament had met and with splendid unhesitating unanimity
      had approved all the steps the Government had taken, had voted large sums
      for the prosecution of the war, and had pledged Canada to the Empire to
      the limit of her power. That fearless challenge flung out into the cloud
      wrapped field of war was like a clear bugle call in the night. It rallied
      and steadied the young nation, touched her pride, and breathed serene
      resolve into the Canadian heart. Canadians of all classes drew a long,
      deep breath of relief as they heard of the action of their Parliament.
      Doubts, uncertainties vanished like morning mists blown by the prairie
      breeze. They knew not as yet the magnitude of the task that lay before
      them, but they knew that whatever it might be, they would not go back from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the second week the last fort in Liege had fallen; Brussels,
      too, was gone; Antwerp threatened. Belgium was lost. From Belgian villages
      and towns were beginning to come those tales of unbelievable atrocities
      that were to shock the world into horrified amazement. These tales read in
      the Canadian papers clutched men's throats and gripped men's hearts as
      with cruel fingers of steel. Canadians were beginning to see red. The
      blood of Belgium's murdered victims was indeed to prove throughout Canada
      and throughout the world the seed of mighty armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the second week Jane could refrain no longer. She wrote to
      Larry.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A NEUTRAL NATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first days of the war were for Larry days of dazed bewilderment and of
      ever-deepening misery. The thing which he had believed impossible had
      come. That great people upon whose generous ideals and liberal Christian
      culture he had grounded a sure hope of permanent peace had flung to the
      winds all the wisdom, and all justice, and all the humanity which the
      centuries had garnered for them, and, following the primal instincts of
      the brute, had hurled forth upon the world ruthless war. Even the great
      political party of the Social Democrats upon which he had relied to make
      war impossible had without protest or division proclaimed enthusiastic
      allegiance to the war programme of the Kaiser. The universities and the
      churches, with their preachers and professors, had led the people in mad
      acclaim of war. His whole thinking on the subject had been proved wrong.
      Passionately he had hoped against hope that Britain would not allow
      herself to enter the war, but apparently her struggle for peace had been
      in vain. His first feeling was one of bitter disappointment and of
      indignation with the great leaders of the British people who had allowed
      themselves to become involved in a Mid-European quarrel. Sir Edward Grey's
      calm, moderate&mdash;sub-moderate, indeed&mdash;exposition of the causes
      which had forced Britain into war did much to cool his indignation, and
      Bethmann-Hollweg's cynical explanation of the violation of Belgium's
      neutrality went far to justify Britain's action consequent upon that
      outraging of treaty faith. The deliberate initiation of the policy of
      "frightfulness" which had heaped such unspeakable horrors upon the Belgian
      people tore the veil from the face of German militarism and revealed in
      its sheer brutality the ruthlessness and lawlessness of that monstrous
      system.
    </p>

      From the day of Austria's ultimatum to Servia Larry began to read
      everything he could find dealing with modern European history, and
      especially German history. Day and night he studied with feverish
      intensity the diplomacy and policies of the great powers of Europe till at
      length he came to a somewhat clear understanding of the modern theory and
      world policy of the German state which had made war inevitable. But,
      though his study made it possible for him to relieve his country from the
      charge of guilt in this war, his anxiety and his misery remained. For one
      thing, he was oppressed with an overwhelming loneliness. He began to feel
      that he was dwelling among an alien people. He had made many and close
      friends during the months of his stay in Chicago. But while they were
      quick to offer him sympathy in his anxiety and misery, he could not fail
      to observe on every hand the obvious and necessary indications of the
      neutral spirit. He could expect nothing else. In this conflict America had
      decided that she was not immediately concerned and she was resolute to
      remain unconcerned. A leading representative of the Chicago press urged
      Americans to be careful not to "rock the boat." The President of the
      United States counselled his people "to keep calm" and to observe the
      strictest neutrality. Larry discovered, too, an unconfessed, almost
      unconscious desire in the heart of many an American, a relic of
      Revolutionary days, to see England not destroyed or even seriously
      disabled, but, say, "well trimmed." It would do her good. There was,
      beside, a large element in the city distinctly and definitely pro-German
      and intensely hostile to Great Britain. On his way to the office one
      afternoon Larry found himself held up by a long procession of young German
      reservists singing with the utmost vigour and with an unmistakable note of
      triumph the German national air, "Die Wacht Am Rhein," and that newer song
      which embodied German faith and German ambition, "Deutschland Uber Alles."
      When he arrived at the office that afternoon he was surprised to find that
      he was unable to go on with his work for the trembling of his hands. In
      the office he was utterly alone, for, however his friends there might take
      pains to show extra kindness, he was conscious of complete isolation from
      their life. Unconcerned, indifferent, coolly critical of the great
      conflict in which his people were pouring out blood like water, they were
      like spectators at a football match on the side lines willing to cheer
      good play on either side and ready to acclaim the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wakehams, though extremely careful to avoid a word or act that might
      give him pain, naturally shared the general feeling of their people. For
      them the war was only another of those constantly recurring European
      scraps which were the inevitable result of the forms of government which
      these nations insisted upon retaining. If peoples were determined to have
      kings and emperors, what other could they expect but wars. France, of
      course, was quite another thing. The sympathy of America with France was
      deep, warm and sincere. America could not forget the gallant Lafayette.
      Besides, France was the one European republic. As for Britain, the people
      of Chicago were content to maintain a profoundly neutral calm, and to a
      certain extent the Wakehams shared this feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Larry's immediate circle, however, there were two exceptions. One,
      within the Wakeham family, was Elfie. Quick to note the signs of
      wretchedness in him and quick to feel the attitude of neutrality assumed
      by her family toward the war, the child, without stint and without
      thought, gave him a love and a sympathy so warm, so passionate, that it
      was to his heart like balm to an open wound. There was no neutrality about
      Elfie. She was openly, furiously pro-Ally. The rights and wrongs of the
      great world conflict were at first nothing to her. With Canada and the
      Canadians she was madly in love, they were Larry's people and for Larry
      she would have gladly given her life. Another exception to the general
      state of feeling was that of Hugo Raeder. From the first Raeder was an
      intense and confessed advocate of the cause of the Allies. From personal
      observation he knew Germany well, and from wide reading he had come to
      understand and appreciate the significance of her world policy. He
      recognised in German autocracy and in German militarism and in German
      ambition a menace to the liberties of Europe. He represented a large and
      intellectually influential class of men in the city and throughout the
      country generally. Graduates of the great universities, men high in the
      leadership of the financial world, the editors of the great newspapers
      almost to a man, magazine editors and magazine writers untinged by racial
      or personal affinity with Germany, these were represented by Raeder, and
      were strongly and enthusiastically in sympathy with the aims of the
      Allies, and as the war advanced became increasingly eager to have their
      country assume a definite stand on the side of those nations whom they
      believed to be fighting for the liberties and rights of humanity. But
      though these exceptions were a source of unspeakable comfort to him, Larry
      carried day by day a growing sense of isolation and an increasing burden
      of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, there was the question of his duty. He had no clear conviction
      as to what his duty was. With all his hatred and loathing of war, he had
      come to the conviction that should he see it to be the right thing for
      him, he would take his place in the fighting line. There appeared,
      however, to be no great need for men in Canada just now. In response to
      the call for twenty-five thousand men for the First Expeditionary Force,
      nearly one hundred thousand had offered. And yet his country was at war;
      his friends whether enlisted for the fighting line or in the civilian
      ranks were under the burden. Should he not return to Canada and find some
      way to help in the great cause? But again, on the other hand, his work
      here was important, he had been treated with great consideration and
      kindness, he had made a place for himself where he seemed to be needed.
      The lack of clear vision of his duty added greatly to his distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wire had informed him in the first days of the war that his
      brother-in-law had gone to rejoin his old regiment in the Coldstream
      Guards. A letter from Nora did not help much. "Jack has gone," she wrote.
      "We all felt he could do nothing else. Even poor, dear Mother agreed that
      nothing else was possible. Kathleen amazes us all. The very day after the
      awful news came, without a word from Jack, I found her getting his things
      together. 'Are you going to let him go?' I asked her, perfectly amazed at
      her coolness. 'Let me go?' said Jack, who was muddling about her. 'Let me
      go? She would not let me stay. Would you, Kathleen?' 'No,' she said, 'I do
      not think I would like you to stay, Jack.' And this is our pacifist,
      Kathleen, mind you! How she came to see through this thing so rapidly I
      don't know. But sooner than any of us Kathleen saw what the war was about
      and that we must get in. She goes about her work quietly, cheerfully. She
      has no illusions, and there is no bravado. Oh, Larry dear, I do not
      believe I could do it. When she smiles at the dear wee man in her arms I
      have to run away or I should howl. I must tell you about Duckworth. You
      know what a dear he is. We have seen a good deal of him this year. He has
      quite captivated Mother. Well, he had a letter from his father saying, 'I
      am just about rejoining my regiment; your brother has enlisted; your
      sister has gone to the Red Cross. We have given our house to the
      Government for a hospital. Come home and join up.' What a man he must be!
      The dear boy came to see us and, Larry, he wanted me. Oh, I wish I could
      have said yes, but somehow I couldn't. Dear boy, I could only kiss him and
      weep over him till he forgot himself in trying to comfort me. He went with
      the Calgary boys. Hec Ross is off, too; and Angus Fraser is up and down
      the country with kilt and pipes driving Scotchmen mad to be at the war.
      He's going, too, although what his old mother will do without him I do not
      know. But she will hear of nothing less. Only four weeks of this war and
      it seems like a year. Switzer has gone, you know, the wicked devil. If it
      had not been for Sam, who had been working around the mine, the whole
      thing would have been blown up with dynamite. Sam discovered the thing in
      time. The Germans have all quit work. Thank God for that. So the mine is
      not doing much. Mother is worried about the war, I can see, thinking
      things through."
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter from Jane helped him some. It was very unlike Jane and evidently
      written under the stress of strong emotion. She gave him full notes of the
      Reverend Andrew McPherson's sermons, which she appeared to set great store
      by. The rapid progress of recruiting filled her with delight. It grieved
      her to think that her friends were going to the war, but that grief was as
      nothing compared to the grief and indignation against those who seemed to
      treat the war lightly. She gave a page of enthusiastic appreciation to
      Kellerman. Another page she devoted to an unsuccessful attempt to repress
      her furious contempt for Lloyd Rushbrooke, who talked largely and coolly
      about the need of keeping sane. The ranks of the first contingent were all
      filled up. She knew there were two million Canadians in the United States
      who if they were needed would flock back home. They were not needed yet,
      and so it would be very foolish for them to leave good positions in the
      meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry read the last sentence with a smile. "Dear old Jane," he said to
      himself. "She wants to help me out; and, by George, she does." Somehow
      Jane's letter brought healing to his lacerated nerves and heart, and
      steadied him to bear the disastrous reports of the steady drive of the
      enemy towards Paris that were released by the censor during the last days
      of that dreadful August. With each day of that appalling retreat Larry's
      agony deepened. The reports were vague, but one thing was clear&mdash;the
      drive was going relentlessly forward, and the French and the British
      armies alike were powerless to stay the overwhelming torrent. The check at
      the Marne lifted the gloom a bit. But the reports of that great fight were
      meagre and as yet no one had been able to estimate the full significance
      of that mighty victory for the Allied armies, nor the part played therein
      by the gallant and glorious little army that constituted the British
      Expeditionary Force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blacker days came in late September, when the news arrived of the disaster
      to the Aboukir and her sister ships, and a month later of the destruction
      of the Good Hope and the Monmouth in the South Pacific sea fight. On that
      dreadful morning on his way downtown he purchased a paper. After the first
      glance he crushed the paper together till he reached his office, where he
      sat with the paper spread out before him on his desk, staring at the
      headlines, unable to see, unable to think, able only to suffer. In the
      midst of his misery Professor Schaefer passed through the office on his
      way to consult with Mr. Wakeham and threw him a smile of cheery triumph.
      It was a way Schaefer had these days. The very sight of him was enough to
      stir Larry to a kind of frenzied madness. This morning the German's smile
      was the filling up of his cup of misery. He stuffed the paper into his
      desk, took up his pen and began to make figures on his pad, gnawing his
      lips the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Hugo Raeder came in with a message for him. Raeder after one
      look at his face took Larry away with him, sick with rage and fear, in his
      car, and for an hour and a half drove through the Park at a rate that
      defied the traffic regulations, talking the while in quiet, hopeful tones
      of the prospects of the Allies, of the marvellous recovery of the French
      and British armies on the Marne and of the splendid Russian victories. He
      touched lightly upon the recent naval disaster, which was entirely due to
      the longer range of the enemy's guns and to a few extraordinarily lucky
      shots. The clear, crisp air, the swift motion, the bright sun, above all
      the deep, kindly sympathy of this strong, clear-thinking man beside him,
      brought back to Larry his courage if not his cheer. As they were nearly
      back to the office again, he ventured his first observation, for
      throughout the drive he had confined his speech to monosyllabic answers to
      Raeder's stream of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of it all, I believe the navy is all right," he said, with
      savage emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear chap," exclaimed Raeder, "did you ever doubt it? Did you read the
      account of the fight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Larry, "only the headlines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you did not see that the British ships were distinctly outclassed in
      guns both as to range and as to weight. Nothing can prevent disaster in
      such a case. It was a bit of British stupidity to send those old cruisers
      on such an expedition. The British navy is all right. If not, then God
      help America."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, old chap," said Larry as they stepped out of the car, "you have done
      me a mighty good turn this morning, and I will not forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is all right," said Raeder. "We have got to stand together in
      this thing, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand together?" said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, stand together. Don't you forget it. We are with you in this. Deep
      down in the heart America is utterly sound; she knows that the cause of
      the Allies is the cause of justice and humanity. America has no use for
      either brutal tyranny or slimy treachery. The real American heart is with
      you now, and her fighting army will yet be at your side."
    </p>
    <p>
      These sentiments were so unusual in his environment that Larry gazed at
      him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is God's truth," said Raeder. "Take a vote of the college men
      to-day, of the big business men, of the big newspaper men&mdash;these
      control the thinking and the acting of America&mdash;and you will find,
      ninety per cent. of these pro-Ally. Just be patient and give the rest of
      us time. Americans will not stand for the bully," added Raeder, putting
      his hand on Larry's shoulder. "You hear me, my boy. Now I am going in to
      see the boss. He thinks the same way, too, but he does not say much out
      loud."
    </p>
    <p>
      New hope and courage came into Larry's heart as he listened to the
      pronouncement of this clear-headed, virile young American. Oh, if America
      would only say out loud what Raeder had been saying, how it would tone up
      the spirit of the Allies! A moral vindication of their cause from America
      would be worth many an army corps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning brought him another and unexpected breeze of cheer in the
      person of Dean Wakeham straight from Alberta and the Lakeside Farm. A
      little before lunch he walked in upon Larry, who was driving himself to
      his work that he might forget. It was a veritable breath from home for
      Larry, for Dean was one who carried not only news but atmosphere as well.
      He was a great, warm-hearted boy, packed with human energies of body,
      heart and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till I say good-morning to father," he said after he had shaken
      hands warmly with Larry. "I will be back then in a minute or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      But in a few minutes Mr. Wakeham appeared and called Larry to him. "Come
      in, boy, and hear the news," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry went in and found Dean in the full tide of a torrential outpouring
      of passionate and enthusiastic, at times incoherent, tales of the
      Canadians, of their spirit, of their sacrifice and devotion in their hour
      of tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, Dean," said Raeder, who was listening with face and eyes aglow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on? I cannot stop. Never have I come up against anything like what is
      going on over there in Canada. Not in one spot, either, but everywhere;
      not in one home, but in every home; not in one class, but in every class.
      In Calgary during the recruiting I saw a mob of men in from the ranches,
      from the C. P. R. shops, from the mines, from the offices, fighting mad to
      get their names down. My God! I had to go away or I would have had mine in
      too. The women, too, are all the same. No man is getting under his wife's
      skirts. You know old Mrs. Ross, Larry, an old Scotch woman up there with
      four sons. Well, her eldest son could not wait for the Canadian
      contingent, but went off with Jack Romayne and joined the Black Watch. He
      was in that Le Cateau fight. Oh, why don't these stupid British tell the
      people something about that great fighting retreat from Mons to the Marne?
      Well, at Le Cateau poor Hec Ross in a glorious charge got his. His Colonel
      wrote the old lady about it. I never saw such a letter; there never was
      one like it. I motored Mrs. Gwynne, your mother, Larry, over to see her.
      Say, men, to see those two women and to hear them! There were no tears,
      but a kind of exaltation. Your mother, Larry, is as bad, as good, I mean,
      as any of them now. I heard that old Scotch woman say to your mother in
      that Scotch voice of hers, 'Misthress Gwynne, I dinna grudge my boy. I
      wouldna hae him back.' Her youngest son is off with the Canadians. As she
      said good-bye to us I heard her say to your mother, 'I hae gi'en twa sons,
      Misthress Gwynne, an' if they're wanted, there's twa mair.' My God! I
      found myself blubbering like a child. It sounds all mad and furious, but
      believe me, there is not much noise, no hurrahing. They know they are up
      against a deadly serious business, and that is getting clearer every
      minute. Did you see that the Government had offered one hundred and fifty
      thousand men now, and more if wanted? And all classes are the same. That
      little Welch preacher at Wolf Willow&mdash;Rhye, his name is, isn't it? By
      George, you should hear him flaming in the pulpit. He's the limit. There
      won't be a man in that parish will dare hold back. He will just have to go
      to war or quit the church. And it is the same all over. The churches are a
      mighty force in Canada, you know, even a political force. I have been
      going to church every Sunday, Father, this last year. Believe me, God is
      some real Person to those people, and I want to tell you He has become
      real to me too." As Dean said this he glanced half defiantly at his father
      as if expecting a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his father only cleared his throat and said, "All right, my boy. We
      won't do anything but gladly agree with you there. And God may come to be
      more real to us all before we are through with this thing. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see, what was I talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Churches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in Calgary, on my way down this time, the Archdeacon preached a
      sermon that simply sent thrills down my spine. In Winnipeg I went with the
      Murrays to church and heard a clergyman, McPherson, preach. The soldiers
      were there. Great Caesar! No wonder Winnipeg is sending out thousands of
      her best men. He was like an ancient Hebrew prophet, Peter the Hermit and
      Billy Sunday all rolled into one. Yet there was no noisy drum pounding and
      no silly flag flapping. Say, let me tell you something. I said there was a
      battalion of soldiers in church that day. The congregation were going to
      take Holy Communion. You know the Scotch way. They all sit in their pews
      and you know they are fearfully strict about their Communion, have rules
      and regulations and so on about it. Well, that old boy McPherson just
      leaned over his pulpit and told the boys what the thing stood for, that it
      was just like swearing in, and he told them that he would just throw the
      rules aside and man to man would ask them to join up with God. Say, that
      old chap got my goat. The boys just naturally stayed to Communion and I
      stayed too. I was not fit, I know, but I do not think it did me any harm."
      At this point the boy's voice broke up and there was silence for some
      moments in the office. Larry had his face covered with his hands to hide
      the tears that were streaming down. Dean's father was openly wiping his
      eyes, Raeder looking stern and straight in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," said Dean suddenly, "I want to give you warning right now. If it
      ever comes that Canada is in need of men, I am not going to hold back. I
      could not do it and stay in the country. I am an American, heart, body and
      soul, but I would count myself meaner than a polecat if I declined to line
      up with that bunch of Canadians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think well, my boy," said his father. "Think well. I have only one son,
      but I will never stand between you and your duty or your honour. Now we go
      to lunch. Where shall we go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With me, at the University Club, all of you," said Raeder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, with me," said Mr. Wakeham. "I will put up the fatted calf, for this
      my son is home again. Eh, my boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      During the lunch hour try as they would they could not get away from the
      war. Dean was so completely obsessed with the subject that he could not
      divert his mind to anything else for any length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot help it," he said at length. "All my switches run the same way."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had almost finished when Professor Schaefer came into the dining
      hall, spied them and hastened over to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's this German beast," said Dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steady, Dean. We do business with him," said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Father," replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor drew in a chair and sat down. He only wanted a light lunch
      and if they would allow him he would break in just where they were. He was
      full of excitement over the German successes on sea and on land.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On land?" said Raeder. "Well, I should not radiate too freely about their
      land successes. What about the Marne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Marne!" said Schaefer in hot contempt. "The Marne&mdash;strategy&mdash;strategy,
      my dear sir. But wait. Wait a few days. If we could only get that boasted
      British navy to venture out from their holes, then the war would be over.
      Mark what happens in the Pacific. Scientific gunnery, three salvos, two
      hundred minutes from the first gun. It is all over. Two British ships sunk
      to the bottom. That is the German way. They would force war upon Germany.
      Now they have it. In spite of all the Kaiser's peace efforts, they drove
      Germany into the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Kaiser!" exclaimed Larry, unable any longer to contain his fury. "The
      Kaiser's peace efforts! The only efforts that the Kaiser has made for the
      last few years are efforts to bully Europe into submission to his will.
      The great peace-maker of Europe of this and of the last century was not
      the Kaiser, but King Edward VII. All the world knows that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "King Edward VII!" sputtered Schaefer in a fury of contempt. "King Edward
      VII a peacemaker! A &mdash;&mdash;!" calling him a vile name. "And his son
      is like him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The foul word was like a flame to powder with Larry. His hand closed upon
      his glass of water. "You are a liar," he said, leaning over and thrusting
      his face close up to the German. "You are a slanderous liar." He flung his
      glass of water full into Schaefer's face, sprang quickly to his feet, and
      as the German rose, swung with his open hand and struck hard upon the
      German's face, first on one cheek and then on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a roar Schaefer flung himself at him, but Larry in a cold fury was
      waiting for him. With a stiff, full-armed blow, which carried the whole
      weight of his body, he caught him on the chin. The professor was lifted
      clear over his chair. Crashing back upon the floor, he lay there still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good boy, Larry," shouted Dean. "Great God! You did something that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent, white, cold, rigid, Larry stood waiting. More than any of them he
      was amazed at what he had done. Some friends of the Professor rushed
      toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand clear, gentlemen," said Raeder. "We are perfectly able to handle
      this. This man offered my friend a deadly insult. My friend simply
      anticipated what I myself would gladly have done. Let me say this to you,
      gentlemen, for some time he and those of his kind have made themselves
      offensive. Every man is entitled to his opinion, but I have made up my
      mind that if any German insults my friends the Allies in my presence, I
      shall treat him as this man has been treated."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more of it. Schaefer's friends after reviving him led him
      off. As they passed out of the dining hall Larry and his friends were held
      up by a score or more of men who crowded around him with warm thanks and
      congratulations. The affair was kept out of the press, but the news of it
      spread to the limits of clubland. The following day Raeder thought it best
      that they should lunch again together at the University Club. The great
      dining-room was full. As Raeder and his company entered there was first a
      silence, then a quick hum of voices, and finally applause, which grew in
      volume till it broke into a ringing cheer. There was no longer any doubt
      as to where the sympathy of the men of the University Club, at least, lay
      in this world conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later a telegram was placed upon Larry's desk. Opening it, he
      read, "Word just received Jack Romayne killed in action." Larry carried
      the telegram quietly into the inner office and laid it upon his chief's
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can stand this no longer, sir," he said in a quiet voice. "I wish you
      to release me. I must return to Canada. I am going to the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, my boy," said Mr. Wakeham. "I know you have thought it over. I
      feel you could not do otherwise. I, too, have been thinking, and I wish to
      say that your place will await you here and your salary will go on so long
      as you are at the war. No! not a word! There is not much we Americans can
      do as yet, but I shall count it a privilege as an American sympathising
      with the Allies in their great cause to do this much at least. And you
      need not worry about that coal mine. Dean has been telling me about it. We
      will see it through."

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAJOR AND THE MAJOR'S WIFE
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Larry went to take farewell of the Wakehams he found Rowena with Hugo
      Raeder in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are glad to leave us," said Rowena, in a tone of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Larry, "sorry. You have been too good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are glad to go to war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I hate the war. I am not a soldier, but, thank God, I see my duty,
      and I am going to have a go at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are," said Hugo. "What else could any man do when his country
      is at war?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hate to go," said Larry, "and I hate this business of saying
      good-bye. You have all been so good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was easy," said Rowena. "Do you know I was on the way to fall in love
      with you? Hugo here and Jane saved me. Oh, I mean it," she added, flushing
      as she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane!" exclaimed Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jane. Oh, you men are so stupid," said Rowena. "And Hugo helped me
      out, too," she added, with a shy glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry looked from one to the other, then rushed to Hugo. "Oh, you lucky
      beggar! You two lucky beggars! Oh, joy, glory, triumph! Could anything be
      finer in the wide world?" cried Larry, giving a hand to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, Larry, don't be a fool," said Rowena. "Try to understand your dear,
      foolish heart, and don't break your own or any one's else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry gazed at her in astonishment and then at Hugo, who nodded wisely at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is quite right, Larry. I want to see that young lady Jane. She must
      be quite unique. I owe her something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, then," said Larry. "I have already seen your mother. Good-bye,
      you dear things. God give you everything good. He has already given you
      almost the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, you dear boy," said Rowena. "I have wanted to kiss you many a
      time, but didn't dare. But now&mdash;you are going to the war"&mdash;there
      was a little break in her voice&mdash;"where men die. Good-bye, Larry,
      dear boy, good-bye." She put her arms about him. "And don't keep Jane
      waiting," she whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were a German, Larry," said Hugo, giving him both hands, "I would
      kiss you too, old boy, but being plain American, I can only say good luck.
      God bless you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find Elfie in her room," said Rowena. "She refuses to say
      good-bye where any one can see her. She is not going to weep. Soldiers'
      women do not weep, she says. Poor kid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry found Elfie in her room, with high lights as of fever on her cheeks
      and eyes glittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going to cry," she said between her teeth. "You need not be
      afraid, Larry. I am going to be like the Canadian women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry took the child in his arms, every muscle and every nerve in her
      slight body taut as a fiddle-string. He smoothed her hair gently and began
      to talk quietly with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What good times we have had!" he said. "I remember well the very first
      night I saw you. Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she breathed, "don't speak of it, or I can't hold in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elfie," said Larry, "our Canadian women when they are seeing their men
      off at the station do not cry; they smile and wave their hands. That is,
      many of them do. But in their own rooms, like this, they cry as much as
      they like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry, Larry," cried the child, flinging herself upon him. "Let me
      cry, then. I can't hold in any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither can I, little girl. See, Elfie, there is no use trying not to,
      and I am not ashamed of it, either," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pent-up emotion broke forth in a storm of sobbing and tears that shook
      the slight body as the tempest shakes the sapling. Larry, holding her in
      his arms, talked to her about the good days they had had together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And isn't it fine to think that we have those forever, and, whenever we
      want to, we can bring them back again? And I want you to remember, Elfie,
      that when I was very lonely and homesick here you were the one that helped
      me most."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Larry, oh, what you did for me!" said the child. "I was so sick
      and miserable and bad and cross and hateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was just because you were not fit," said Larry. "But now you are fit
      and fine and strong and patient, and you will always be so. Remember it is
      a soldier's duty to keep fit." Elfie nodded. "And I want you to send me
      socks and a lot of things when I get over there. I shall write you all
      about it, and you will write me. Won't you?" Again Elfie nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you let me cry," she said. "I was so hot and sore here," and
      she laid her hands upon her throat. "And I am glad you cried too, Larry;
      and I won't cry before people, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right. There are going to be too many sad people about for us to
      go crying and making them feel worse," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I will say good-bye here, Larry. I could go to the train, but then I
      might not quite smile."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the train pulled out that night the last face that Larry saw of
      all his warm-hearted American friends was that of the little girl, who
      stood alone at the end of the platform, waving both her hands wildly over
      her head, her pale face effulgent with a glorious smile, through which the
      tears ran unheeded down her cheeks like rain on a sunny day. And on
      Larry's face, as he turned away, there was the same gleam of sunshine and
      of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This farewell business is something too fierce," he said to himself
      savagely, thinking with a sinking heart of the little group at Wolf Willow
      in the West to whom he must say farewell, and of the one he must leave
      behind in Winnipeg. "How do these women send their husbands off and their
      sons? God knows, it is beyond me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the train journey to Calgary his mind was chiefly occupied with
      the thought of the parting that awaited him. But when he reached his
      destination he found himself so overwhelmed with the rush of preparation
      and with the strenuous daily grind of training that he had no time nor
      energy left for anything but his work. A change, too, was coming swiftly
      over the heart of Canada and over his own heart. The tales of Belgian
      atrocities, at first rejected as impossible, but afterwards confirmed by
      the Bryce Commission and by many private letters, kindled in Canadian
      hearts a passion of furious longing to wipe from the face of the earth a
      system that produced such horrors. Women who, with instincts native of
      their kind, had at the first sought how they might with honour keep back
      their men from the perils of war, now in their compassion for women thus
      relentlessly outraged and for their tender babes pitilessly mangled,
      consulted chiefly how they might best fit their men for the high and holy
      mission of justice for the wronged and protection for the helpless. It was
      this that wrought in Larry a fury of devotion to his duty. Night and day
      he gave himself to his training with his concentrated powers of body, mind
      and soul, till he stood head and shoulders above the members of the
      Officers' Training Corps at Calgary.
    </p>
    <p>
      After six weeks of strenuous grind Larry was ordered to report to his
      battalion at Wolf Willow. A new world awaited him there, a world recreated
      by the mysterious alchemy of war, a world in which men and women moved
      amid high ideals and lofty purposes, a world where the dominant note was
      sacrifice and the regnant motive duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora met him at the station in her own car, which, in view of her activity
      in connection with the mine where her father was now manager, the
      directors had placed at her disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How big and fine you look, Larry! You must be pounds heavier," she cried,
      viewing him from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty pounds, and hard as hickory. Never so fit in my life," replied her
      brother, who was indeed a picture of splendid and vigorous health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are perfectly astonishing. But everything is astonishing these days.
      Why, even father, till he broke his leg&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Broke his leg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no use worrying you about it. A week ago, while he was
      pottering about the mine, he slipped down a ladder and broke his leg. He
      will probably stay where he belongs now&mdash;in the office. But father is
      as splendid as any one could well be. He has gripped that mine business
      hard, and even Switzer in his palmiest days could not get better results.
      He has quite an extraordinary way with the men, and that is something
      these days, when men are almost impossible to get."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mother?" enquired Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother is equally surprising. But you will see for yourself. And dear old
      Kathleen. She is at it day and night. They made her President of the
      Women's War Association, and she is&mdash;Well, it is quite beyond words.
      I can't talk about it, that's all." Nora's voice grew unsteady and she
      took refuge in silence. After a few moments she went on: "And she has had
      the most beautiful letter from Jack's colonel. It was on the Big Retreat
      from Mons that he was killed at the great fight at Landrecies. You know
      about that, Larry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, never heard anything; I know really nothing of that retreat," said
      Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we have had letters about it. It must have been great. Oh, it will
      be a glorious tale some day. They began the fight, only seventy-five
      thousand of the British&mdash;think of it! with two hundred guns against
      four hundred thousand Germans with six hundred guns. They began the fight
      on a Saturday. The French on both their flanks gave way. One army on each
      flank trying to hem them in and an army in front pounding the life out of
      them. They fought all Saturday. They began the retreat on Saturday night,
      fought again Sunday, marched Sunday night, they fought Monday and marched
      Monday night, fought Tuesday, and marched Tuesday night. The letter said
      they staggered down the roads like drunken men. Wednesday, dead beat, they
      fought again&mdash;and against ever fresh masses of men, remember.
      Wednesday night one corps came to Landrecies. At half-past nine they were
      all asleep in billets. At ten o'clock a perfectly fresh army of the enemy,
      field guns backing them up behind, machine guns in front, bore down the
      streets into the village. But those wonderful Coldstreams and Grenadiers
      and Highlanders just filled the streets and every man for himself poured
      in rifle fire, and every machine gun fired into the enemy masses, smashed
      the attack and then they went at them with the bayonet and flung them
      back. Again and again throughout the night this thing was repeated until
      the Germans drew off, leaving five hundred dead before the village and in
      its streets. It was in the last bayonet charge, when leading his men, that
      Jack was killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" cried Larry. "What a great death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so Kathleen goes about with her head high and Sybil, too,&mdash;Mrs.
      Waring-Gaunt, you know," continued Nora, "she is just like the others. She
      never thinks of herself and her two little kids who are going to be left
      behind but she is busy getting her husband ready and helping to outfit his
      men, as all the women are, with socks and mits and all the rest of it.
      Before Tom made up his mind to raise the battalion they were both
      wretched, but now they are both cheery as crickets with a kind of exalted
      cheeriness that makes one feel like hugging the dear things. And, Larry,
      there won't be a man left in this whole country if the war keeps on except
      old McTavish, who is furious because they won't take him and who declares
      he is going on his own. Poor Mr. Rhye is feeling so badly. He was rejected&mdash;heart
      trouble, though I think he is more likely to injure himself here preaching
      as he does than at the war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yourself, Nora? Carrying the whole load, I suppose,&mdash;ranch, and
      now this mine. You are getting thin, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear," said Nora. "Joe is really doing awfully well on the ranch. He
      practically takes charge. By the way, Sam has enlisted. He says he is
      going to stick to you. He is going to be your batman. And as for the mine,
      since father's accident Mr. Wakeham has been very kind. If he were not an
      American he would have enlisted before this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! he would, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would, or he would not be coming about Lakeside Farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he does come about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Nora with an exaggerated air of indifference. "He would be
      rather a nuisance if he were not so awfully useful and so jolly. After
      all, I do not see what we should have done without him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, a good man is Dean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a letter from Jane this week," continued Nora, changing the subject
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not heard for two weeks," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have not heard about Scuddy. Poor Scuddy! But why say 'poor'
      Scuddy? He was doing his duty. It was a patrol party. He was scouting and
      ran into an enemy patrol and was instantly killed. The poor girl, Helen
      Brookes, I think it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen Brookes!" exclaimed Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jane says you knew her. She was engaged to Scuddy. And Scallons is
      gone too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scallons!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Smart, Frank Smart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank Smart! Oh! his poor mother! My God, this war is awful and grows
      more awful every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane says Mrs. Smart is at every meeting of the Women's Association,
      quiet and steady, just like our Kathleen. Oh, Larry, how can they do it?
      If my husband&mdash;if I had one&mdash;were killed I could not, I just
      could not, bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy, little girl, you would measure up like the others. This is a
      damnable business, but we never knew our women till now. But the sooner
      that cursed race is wiped off the face of the earth the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Larry, is that you? I cannot believe my ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is me. I have come to see that there is no possibility of peace
      or sanity for the world till that race of mad militarists is destroyed. I
      am still a pacifist, but, thank God, no longer a fool. Is there no other
      news from Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hear about Ramsay Dunn? Oh, he did splendidly. He was wounded;
      got a cross or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you know that Mr. Murray had organised a battalion and is
      Lieutenant-Colonel and that Doctor Brown is organising a Field Ambulance
      unit and going out in command?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is settled, is it? Jane told me it was possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and perhaps Jane and Ethel Murray will go with the Ambulance Unit.
      Oh, Larry, is there any way I might go? I could do so much&mdash;drive a
      car, an ambulance, wash, scrub, carry despatches, anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove, you would be a good one!" exclaimed her brother. "I would like
      to have you in my company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't it be worked in any possible way?" cried Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Larry made no reply. He knew well that no reply was needed. What was
      her duty this splendid girl would do, whether in Flanders or in Alberta.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of their home the mother met them. As her eyes fell upon her
      son in his khaki uniform she gave a little cry and ran to him with arms
      uplifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come right in here," she whispered, and took him to the inner room. There
      she drew him to the bedside and down upon his knees. With their arms about
      each other they knelt, mingling tears and sobs together till their
      strength was done. Then through the sobs the boy heard her voice. "You
      gave him to me," he heard her whisper, not in her ordinary manner of
      reverent formal prayer, but as if remonstrating with a friend. "You know
      you gave him to me and I gave him back.&mdash;I know he is not mine.&mdash;But
      won't you let me have him for a little while?&mdash;It will not be so very
      long.&mdash;Yes, yes, I know.&mdash;I am not holding him back.&mdash;No,
      no, I could not, I would not do that.&mdash;Oh, I would not.&mdash;What am
      I better than the others?&mdash;But you will give him back to me again.&mdash;There
      are so many never coming back, and I have only one boy.&mdash;You will let
      him come back.&mdash;He is my baby boy.&mdash;It is his mother asking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry could bear it no longer. "Oh, mother, mother, mother," he cried.
      "You are breaking my heart. You are breaking my heart." His sobs were
      shaking the bed on which he leaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother lifted her head. "What is it, Lawrence, my boy?" she asked in
      surprise. "What is it?" Her voice was calm and steady. "We must be
      steadfast, my boy. We must not grudge our offering. No, with willing
      hearts we must bring our sacrifice." She passed into prayer. "Thou, who
      didst give Thy Son, Thine only Son, to save Thy world, aid me to give mine
      to save our world to-day. Let the vision of the Cross make us both strong.
      Thou Cross-bearer, help us to bear our cross." With a voice that never
      faltered, she poured forth her prayer of sacrifice, of thanksgiving, of
      supplication, till serene, steady, triumphant, they arose from their
      knees. She was heard "in that she feared," in her surrender she found
      victory, in her cross, peace. And that serene calm of hers remained
      undisturbed to the very last.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears again at the parting, but the tears fell gently, and
      through them shone ever her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few short days Larry spent at his home moving about among those that
      were dearer to him than his own life, wondering the while at their courage
      and patience and power to sacrifice. In his father he seemed to discover a
      new man, so concentrated was he in his devotion to business, and so wise,
      his only regret being that he could not don the king's uniform. With
      Kathleen he spent many hours. Not once throughout all these days did she
      falter in her steady, calm endurance, and in her patient devotion to duty.
      Without tears, without a word of repining against her cruel fate, with
      hardly a suggestion, indeed, of her irreparable loss, she talked to him of
      her husband and of his glorious death.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two months an unexpected order called the battalion on twenty-four
      hours' notice for immediate service over seas, and amid the cheers of
      hundreds of their friends and fellow citizens, although women being in the
      majority, the cheering was not of the best, they steamed out of Melville
      Station. There were tears and faces white with heartache, but these only
      after the last cheer had been flung upon the empty siding out of which the
      cars of the troop-train had passed. The tears and the white faces are for
      that immortal and glorious Army of the Base, whose finer courage and more
      heroic endurance make victory possible to the army of the Fighting First
      Line.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Winnipeg the train was halted for a day and a night, where the
      battalion ENJOYED the hospitality of the city which never tires of
      welcoming and speeding on the various contingents of citizen soldiers of
      the West en route for the Front. There was a dinner and entertainment for
      the men. For Larry, because he was Acting Adjutant, there was no respite
      from duty through all the afternoon until the men had been safely disposed
      in the care of those who were to act as their hosts at dinner. Then the
      Colonel took him off to Jane and her father, who were waiting with their
      car to take them home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My! but you do look fine in your uniform," said Jane, "and so strong, and
      so big; you have actually grown taller, I believe." Her eyes were fairly
      standing out with pride and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much difference north and south," said Larry, "but east and west,
      considerable. And you, Jane, you are looking better than ever. Whatever
      has happened to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard work," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear you are in the Big Business up to your neck," said Larry. "There
      is so much to do, I can well believe it. And so your father is going? How
      splendid of him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, every one is doing what he can do best. Father will do the ambulance
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I hear you are going too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know about that," said Jane. "Isn't it awfully hard to tell just
      what to do? I should love to go, but that is the very reason I wonder
      whether I should. There is so much to do here, and there will be more and
      more as we go on, so many families to look after, so much work to keep
      going; work for soldiers, you know, and for their wives and children, and
      collecting money. And it is all so easy to do, for every one is eager to
      do what he can. I never knew people could be so splendid, Larry, and
      especially those who have lost some one. There is Mrs. Smart, for
      instance, and poor Scallan's mother, and Scuddy's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," said Larry abruptly, "I must see Helen. Can we go at once when we
      take the others home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take you," said Jane. "I am glad you can go. Oh, she is lovely,
      and so sweet, and so brave."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the Colonel in Dr. Brown's care, they drove to the home of Helen
      Brookes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dread seeing her," said Larry, as they approached the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you need not dread that," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after one look at Helen's face Larry knew that Jane was right. The
      bright colour in the face, the proud carriage of the head, the saucy look
      in the eye, once so characteristic of the "beauty queen" of the 'Varsity,
      were all gone. But the face was no less beautiful, the head carried no
      less proudly, the eye no less bright. There was no shrinking in her
      conversation from the tragic fact of her lover's death. She spoke quite
      freely of Scuddy's work in the battalion, of his place with the men and of
      how they loved him, and all with a fine, high pride in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The officers, from the Colonel down, have been so good to me," she said.
      "They have told me so many things about Harry. And the Sergeants and the
      Corporals, every one in his company, have written me. They are beautiful
      letters. They make me laugh and cry, but I love them. Dear boys, how I
      love them, and how I love to work for them!" She showed Larry a thick
      bundle of letters. "And they all say he was so jolly. I like that, for you
      know, being a Y. M. C. A. man in college and always keen about that sort
      of thing&mdash;I am afraid I did not help him much in that way&mdash;he
      was not so fearfully jolly. But now I am glad he was that kind of a man, a
      good man, I mean, in the best way, and that he was always jolly. One boy
      says, 'He always bucked me up to do my best,' and another, a Sergeant,
      says, 'He put the fear of God into the slackers,' and the Colonel says,
      'He was a moral tonic in the mess,' and his chum officer said, 'He kept us
      all jolly and clean.' I love that. So you see I simply have to buck up and
      be jolly too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen, you are wonderful," said Larry, who was openly wiping away his
      tears. "Scuddy was a big man, a better man I never knew, and you are
      worthy of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were passing out of the room when Helen pulled Larry back again.
      "Larry," she said, her words coming with breathless haste, "don't wait,
      oh, don't wait. Marry Jane before you go. That is my great regret to-day.
      Harry wanted to be married and I did too. But father and mother did not
      think it wise. They did not know. How could they? Oh! Larry," she suddenly
      wrung her hands, "he wished it so. Now I know it would have been best.
      Don't make my mistake, don't, Larry. Don't make my mistake. Thank you for
      coming to see me. Good-bye, Larry, dear. You were his best friend. He
      loved you so." She put her arms around his neck and kissed him, hastily
      wiped her eyes, and passed out to Jane with a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried away, for the hours in Winnipeg were short and there was much
      to do and much to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her go, Jane," said Larry. "I am in a deuce of a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Larry, what is the rush about just now?" said Jane in a slightly
      grieved voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have something I must attend to at once," said Larry. "So let her go."
      And Jane drove hard, for the most part in silence, till they reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry could hardly wait till she had given her car into the chauffeur's
      charge. They found Dr. Brown and the Colonel in the study smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Brown," said Larry, in a quick, almost peremptory voice, "may I see
      you for a moment or two in your office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's up? Not feeling well?" said Dr. Brown, while the others
      looked anxiously at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am fit enough," said Larry impatiently, "but I must see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure there is something wrong," said Jane, "he has been acting so
      queer this evening. He is so abrupt. Is that the military manner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so," said the Colonel. "Nice chap, Larry&mdash;hard worker&mdash;good
      soldier&mdash;awfully keen in his work&mdash;making good too&mdash;best
      officer I've got. Tell you a secret, Jane&mdash;expect promotion for him
      any time now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Larry was facing Dr. Brown in his office. "Doctor," he said, "I
      want to marry Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens, when did this strike you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This evening. I want to marry her right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right away? When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right away, before I go. To-night, to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you mad? You cannot do things like that, you know. Marry Jane! Do you
      know what you are asking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Doctor, I know. But I have just seen Helen Brookes. She is perfectly
      amazing, perfectly fine in her courage and all that, and she told me about
      Scuddy's death without a tear. But, Doctor, there was a point at which she
      broke all up. Do you know when? When she told me of her chief regret, and
      that was that she and Scuddy had not been married. They both wanted to be
      married, but her parents were unwilling. Now she regrets it and she will
      always regret it. Doctor, I see it very clearly. I believe it is better
      that we should be married. Who knows what will come? So many of the chaps
      do not come back. You are going out too, I am going out. Doctor, I feel
      that it is best that we should be married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what does Jane think about it?" enquired the Doctor, gazing at Larry
      in a bewildered manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane! Good Lord! I don't know. I never asked her!" Larry stood gaping at
      the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, upon my word, you are a cool one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought of it, Doctor," said Larry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never thought of it? Are you playing with me, boy?" said the Doctor
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go and see her," said Larry, and he dashed from the room. But as
      he entered the study, dinner was announced, and Larry's question perforce
      must wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was a meal so long-drawn-out and so tedious. The Colonel and Jane
      were full of conversation. They discussed the news from the West, the mine
      and its prospects, the Lakeside Farm and its people, the Colonel's own
      family, the boys who had enlisted and those who were left behind, the war
      spirit of Canada, its women and their work and their heroism (here the
      Colonel talked softly), the war and its prospects. The Colonel was a
      brilliant conversationalist when he exerted himself, and he told of the
      way of the war in England, of the awakening of the British people, of the
      rush to the recruiting offices, of the women's response. He had tales,
      too, of the British Expeditionary Force which he had received in private
      letters, of its glorious work in the Great Retreat and afterwards. Jane
      had to tell of her father's new Unit, now almost complete, of Mr. Murray's
      new battalion, now in barracks, of the Patriotic Fund and how splendidly
      it was mounting up into the hundreds of thousands, and of the Women's War
      Association, of which she was Secretary, and of the Young Women's War
      Organisation, of which she was President; and all with such animation,
      with such radiant smiles, with such flashing eyes, such keen swift play of
      thought and wit that Larry could hardly believe his eyes and ears, so
      immense was the change that had taken place in Jane during these ten
      months. He could hardly believe, as he glanced across the table at her
      vivid face, that this brilliant, quick-witted, radiant girl was the quiet,
      demure Jane of his college days, his good comrade, his chum, whom he had
      been inclined to patronise. What was this that had come to her? What had
      released those powers of mind and soul which he could now recognise as
      being her own, but which he had never seen in action. As in a flash it
      came to him that this mighty change was due to the terribly energising
      touch of War. The development which in normal times would have required
      years to accomplish, under the quickening impulse of this mighty force
      which in a day was brought to bear upon the life of Canada, this
      development became a thing of weeks and months only. War had poured its
      potent energies through her soul and her soul had responded in a new and
      marvellous efflorescence. Almost over night as it were the flower of an
      exquisite womanhood, strong, tender, sweet, beautiful, had burst into
      bloom. Her very face was changed. The activities with which her days and
      nights were filled had quickened all her vital forces so that the very
      texture and colour of her skin radiated the bloom of vigorous mental and
      physical health. Yet withal there remained the same quick, wise sympathy,
      quicker, wiser than before war's poignant sorrows had disciplined her
      heart; the same far-seeing vision that anticipated problems and planned
      for their solution; the same proud sense of honour that scorned things
      mean and gave quick approval to things high. As he listened Larry felt
      himself small and poor in comparison with her. More than that he had the
      sense of being excluded from her life. The war and its activities, its
      stern claims, its catastrophic events had taken possession of the girl's
      whole soul. Was there a place for him in this new, grand scheme of life? A
      new and terrible master had come into the lordship of her heart. Had love
      yielded its high place? To that question Larry was determined to have an
      answer to-night. To-morrow he was off to the Front. The growing fury of
      the war, its appalling losses, made it increasingly doubtful that he
      should ever see her face again. What her answer would be he could not
      surely say. But to-night he would have it from her. If "yes" there was
      time to-morrow to be married; if "no" then the more gladly he would go to
      the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the Doctor and the Colonel took their way to the study to
      smoke and talk over matters connected with military organisation, in
      regard to which the Doctor confessed himself to be woefully ignorant. Jane
      led Larry into the library, where a bright fire was burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully jolly, this fire. We'll do without the lights," said Larry,
      touching the switch and drawing their chairs forward to the fire,
      wondering the while how he should get himself to the point of courage
      necessary to his purpose. Had it been a few months ago how easy it would
      have been. He could see himself with easy camaraderie put his arm about
      Jane with never a quiver of voice or shiver of soul, and say to her,
      "Jane, you dear, dear thing, won't you marry me?" But at that time he had
      neither desire nor purpose. Now by some damnable perversity of things,
      when heart and soul were sick with the longing for her, and his purpose
      set to have her, he found himself nerveless and shaking like a silly girl.
      He pushed his chair back so that, unaware to her, his eyes could rest upon
      her face, and planned his approach. He would begin by speaking of Helen,
      of her courage, of her great loss, then of her supreme regret, at which
      point he would make his plea. But Jane would give him no help at all.
      Silent she sat looking into the fire, all the vivacity and brilliance of
      the past hour gone, and in its place a gentle, pensive sadness. The
      firelight fell on her face, so changed from what it had been in those
      pre-war days, now so long ago, yet so familiar and so dear. To-morrow at
      this hour he would be far down the line with his battalion, off for the
      war. What lay beyond that who could say? If she should refuse&mdash;"God
      help me then," he groaned aloud, unthinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Larry?" she said, turning her face quickly toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just thinking, Jane, that to-morrow I&mdash;that is&mdash;" He
      paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Larry, I know, I know." Her hands went quickly to her breast. In her
      eyes he saw a look of pain so acute, so pitiful, that he forgot all his
      plan of approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," he cried in a voice sharp with the intensity of his feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant they were both on their feet and facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, dear, dear Jane, I love you so, and I want you so." He stretched
      out his arms to take her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled, her face gone deadly pale, she put out her hands against his
      breast, pushing him away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Larry!" she said. "Larry, what are you saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jane, I am saying I love you; with all my heart and soul, I love you
      and I want you, Jane. Don't you love me a bit, even a little bit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly her arms dropped to her side. "You love me, Larry?" she whispered.
      Her eyes began to glow like stars in a pool of water, deep and lustrous,
      her lips to quiver. "You love me, Larry, and you want me to&mdash;to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jane, I want you to be my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife, Larry?" she whispered, coming a little closer to him. "Oh,
      Larry," she laid her hands upon his breast, "I love you so, and I have
      loved you so long." The lustrous eyes were misty, but they looked steadily
      into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear heart, dear love," he said, drawing her close to him and still
      gazing into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wound her arms about his neck and with lips slightly parted lifted her
      face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, Jane, you wonderful girl," he said, and kissed the parted lips,
      while about them heaven opened and took them to its bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had come back to earth Larry suddenly recalled his conversation
      with her father. "Jane," he said, "when shall we be married? I must tell
      your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married?" said Jane in a voice of despair. "Not till you return, Larry."
      Then she clung to him trembling. "Oh, why were you so slow, Larry? Why did
      you delay so long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slow?" cried Larry. "Well, we can make up for it now." He looked at his
      watch. "It's nine o'clock, Jane. We can be married to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, you silly boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then to-morrow we shall be married, I swear. We won't make Helen's
      mistake." And he told her of Helen Brookes's supreme regret. "We won't
      make that mistake, Jane. To-morrow! To-morrow! To-morrow it will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Larry, listen. Papa&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father will agree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clothes? You don't need any. What you have on will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This old thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly lovely, perfectly splendid. Never will you wear anything so
      lovely as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then, Larry, what should I do? Where would I go? You are going off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane's wise head was thinking swiftly. "I might come across with
      Papa," she said. "We were thinking&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," cried Larry. "You come with me. He will follow and pick you up in
      London. Hurry, come along and tell him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Larry, this is awful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid, glorious, come along. We'll settle all that later."
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged her, laughing, blushing, almost weeping, to the study. "She
      says she will do it to-morrow, sir," he announced as he pushed open the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say?" said the Doctor, gazing open-mouthed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says she will marry me to-morrow," he proclaimed as if announcing a
      stupendous victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does!" said the Doctor, still aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" exclaimed the Colonel. "To-morrow? We are off to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry swung upon him eagerly. "Before we go, sir. There is lots of time.
      You see we do not pull out until after three. We have all the morning, if
      you could spare me an hour or so. We could get married, and she would just
      come along with us, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane gasped. "With all those men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" exclaimed the Colonel. "The boy is mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might perhaps take the later train," suggested Jane demurely. "But, of
      course, Papa, I have never agreed at all," she added quickly, turning to
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That settles it, I believe," said Dr. Brown. "Colonel, what do you say?
      Can it be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done?" shouted the Colonel. "Of course, it can be done. Military wedding,
      guard of honour, band, and all that sort of thing. Proper style, first in
      the regiment, eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But nothing is ready," said Jane, appalled at the rush of events. "Not a
      dress, not a bridesmaid, nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have got a 'phone," cried Larry, gloriously oblivious of
      difficulties. "Tell everybody. Oh, sir," he said, turning to Dr. Brown
      with hand outstretched, "I hope you will let her come. I promise you I
      will be good to her."

      Dr. Brown looked at the young man gravely, almost sadly, then at his
      daughter. With a quick pang he noted the new look in her eyes. He put out
      his hand to her and drew her toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear child," he said, and his voice sounded hoarse and strained, "how
      like you are to your mother to-night." Her arms went quickly about his
      neck. He held her close to him for a few moments; then loosing her arms,
      he pushed her gently toward Larry, saying, "Boy, I give her to you. As you
      deal with her, so may God deal with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen," said Larry solemnly, taking her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was such a wedding in Winnipeg! Nothing was lacking to make it
      perfectly, gloriously, triumphantly complete. There was a wedding dress,
      and a bridal veil with orange blossoms. There were wedding gifts, for
      somehow, no one ever knew how, the morning Times had got the news. There
      was a church crowded with friends to wish them well, and the regimental
      band with a guard of honour, under whose arched swords the bride and groom
      went forth. Never had the Reverend Andrew McPherson been so happy in his
      marriage service. Never was such a wedding breakfast with toasts and
      telegrams from absent friends, from Chicago, and from the Lakeside Farm in
      response to Larry's announcements by wire. Two of these excited wild
      enthusiasm. One read, "Happy days. Nora and I following your good example.
      See you later in France. Signed, Dean." The other, from the Minister of
      Militia at Ottawa to Lieutenant-Colonel Waring-Gaunt. "Your suggestion
      approved. Captain Gwynne gazetted to-morrow as Major. Signed, Sam Hughes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies and Gentlemen," cried the Colonel, beaming upon the company,
      "allow me to propose long life and many happy days for the Major and the
      Major's wife." And as they drank with tumultuous acclaim, Larry turned
      and, looking upon the radiant face at his side, whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, did you hear what he said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," whispered Jane. "He said 'the Major.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's nothing," said Larry, "but he said 'the Major's wife!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so together they went to the war.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
